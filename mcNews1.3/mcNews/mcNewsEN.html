      <br>
      <b>The homepage</b> ( index.php ) shows to the guest a navigation bar with 
      three links:<br>
      <b>list</b> (list.php)<br>
      <b>search</b> (search.php) <br>
      <b>submit</b> (ecrire.php) <br>
      Below this bar the x last News are shown in detail:<br>
      Date, title and author, followed by icons / links towards the site and the 
      email of the author if he indicated them in the ecrire.php form. The site 
      opens in a new window, and the email sends to a contact form mailto.php, 
      the address email remaining so invisible. One finds then the text of the 
      News, then until three links followed by their description. Then the guest 
      can <b>read</b> comments (lire.php) if there's, or to <b>write</b> one (comment.php).</font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a><b>List</b></a> 
      </font>displays the xx last News, classified by date, with subject and author. 
      A click on one of them sends to the page <b>read</b>. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Search</b> suggests a research in all News with one to three words-keys, 
      the operator AND or OR, and the possibility looking for in the authors, 
      the titles or the texts. The result appears as the page <b>list</b>.<br>
      <br>
      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Submit</b> 
      is the form to submit aNews. No limitation, every guest can propose one 
      News, but it must be validated by you before being published. The required 
      fields are: Name, Title and Text. Email is optional, but must be valid if 
      filled. It's possible to insert until three links and their description 
      at the end of text, and four smilies are automatically managed: :) &nbsp;:( 
      &nbsp;:grr: and ?!? are replaced by <img src="images/content.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)">&nbsp;<img src="images/cry.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(">&nbsp;<img src="images/grr.gif" width="16" height="16" alt=":grr:"> 
      and <img src="images/crazy2.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="?!?">. HTML 
      tags aren't recognized, avoiding nasty tricks. You receive an email informing 
      you about the submission of a News and inviting you to go to validate it.<br>
      Privilege administrator: by typing admin in the field name and by validating, 
      you're redirected to the reserved form (see lower).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Read</b> one or several comments displays the News concerned and below 
      all the comments added by the readers. Comments appear as News, the title 
      less.<br>
      The same privilege for the administrator as above.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Write</b> thus allows to comment a News. As <b>submit</b>, every guest 
      can post a comment, but you've to validate it so that it's published. The 
      characteristics of the comment form are the same that those of News, and 
      you're also warned by mail.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>- Section administration</b><br>
      <br>
      Once crossed the login page, several choices:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Design parameters</b> (design.php). You choose here the appearance of 
      mcNews (only for the public part) according to the files which are in the 
      <b>skin</b> directory. You'll find there only two for the moment, up to 
      you to write one matched with your site. And especially, please, think of 
      sending them to me, I shall give them to all.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Technical parameters</b> (tech.php). It's here necessary to choose the 
      language, in the same way as for skins, files being in the lang directory. 
      The same demand of my part, please, send your translations! You also have 
      to fill the other fields. The name is the one you want to see appearing 
      in &quot;author&quot; on your News, the email is for the warning of post 
      and the site URL for the link which allows you to leave the admin after 
      logout. The number of News on homepage corresponds among News &quot;displayed&quot; 
      that you want to see appearing (generally from 5 to 10, but the choice is 
      free, attention at the speed because of the number of requests), the number 
      of News in page list can be much bigger, as far as it also determines the 
      number of possible answers in <b>search</b>.<br>
      <br>
      <b>News waiting for validation</b> shows you the list. To click one sends 
      you to the page <b>accept modify delete</b> (valid.php )<br>
      <br>
      <b>Comments to be validated</b>: here are listed News already validated 
      but which received a new comment. The links send you to the same page as 
      above.<br>
      <br>
      <b>News validated </b>is the list of all News for which there's nothing 
      again. Please, use it todelete the oldest News, to avoid the clogging of 
      the data base. Always the same page.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Publish a News</b>, at the top to the right, opens you a form pre-filled 
      with your name and email address (fixed in the technical parameters). In 
      this form you can use HTML tags, to write in colours, in fat, even insert 
      images or links into the text. Everything is possible, even the errors! 
      Thus, please, be careful. On the other hand Administrator's News are validated 
      immediately.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Accept Modify Delete</b> displays a News and its eventuels comments. 
      Click accept to validate it, modify opens a form allowing you to modify 
      everything, and to add HTML tags if you want. One News which you modify 
      must be then validated, the accepted word is then red. Same procedures for 
      comments. Delete a News also deletes all its comments, delete a comment 
      deletes only itself. You can also from this page write a comment, and as 
      administrator it enjoys privileges already seen higher.<br>

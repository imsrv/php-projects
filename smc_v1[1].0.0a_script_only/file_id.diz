Solace MUD Client (SMC) v1.0.0a

SMC is a PHP script, that allows your telnet client to connect to
the MUDs or any other server through a telnet protocol.
It acts like a proxy-server between telnet client
and server, parsing all incoming and outgoing data.
SMC allows you to work will all well-known databases, internet
(sockets, ftp, http, etc.), extended text parsing and much more...

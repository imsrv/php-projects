Well, all should be fairly simple to guess what it does :).

Anyway, here is some hints:

- edit the header.inc.php and footer.inc.php files to change the layout.
- you can put .welcome files in your pictures directories and they will be shown
  just before the thumbnails.
- make a link with <a href="?lastcomments=/"> in your home .welcome to direct 
  the users into the latest added comments page.
- make a link with <a href="?topratings=1"> in your home .welcome to direct 
  the users into the latest added comments page.
- if the thumbnails are not generated, verify that the directory has the right
  attributes/owner.
- You can use your personal language file, just copy the original one to some name
  of your choice like 'lang_cust.inc.php' and change the language file reference in
  the config file.
- when creating new users, enter random (and large) numbers in cookieval.
- 2nd image comment as show here :
  http://ronography.com/?display=Stuff%2FBBS%20ads%2Fdeadline.jpg
  is done by creating a file with the "_comment" extension. 
  So let's say you have an image called DTC0224.JPG, just create a 
  DTC0224.JPG_comment file with the comment inside.
- image sorting can be reversed by putting a dummy ".desc" file into the directory you want to
  be sorted backwards.
- if you choose to make the thumbnails and low res pictures yourself (by putting "manual" in
  the $thumb_generator variable), then here is the guideline:
      - you need to create a ".thumbs" directory inside all of your images directories
      - you need to put there a "thumb_<IMAGE_FILENAME>" and a "lr_<IMAGE_FILENAME>" file.
        So, if you have an image called "DTC0224.jpg", you need to create "thumb_DTC0224.jpg"
	and "lr_DTC0224.jpg" in the ".thumbs" directory.
- to manage users, use either phpMyAdmin in MySQL database and modify the 'users' table or
  edit the 'users.dat' file if using the fast text database.
- if you want to add new features, go ahead and send me the patches :)

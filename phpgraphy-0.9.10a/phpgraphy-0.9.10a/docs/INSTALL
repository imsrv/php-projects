phpGraphy - Quick Install Instructions
--------------------------------------

This file does just contain the minimum of instructions to install phpGraphy
For full instructions please read the manual, either by using the version
included in this archive "phpgraphy-manual.html" or by going on the official
website: http://phpgraphy.sourceforge.net.

Requirements:

 - A WebServer with PHP 4.1.0 or greater (PHP 4.3.0 recommended)


Quick Installation:

This procedure is an easy way of installing phpGraphy with all defaults choices,
it should be enough in most cases, however please note that there is a more complete
documentation available online (See header of this file for details).

  - Get the archive, unpack it and upload the content on your webserver

  - Load the page corresponding to your phpgraphy installation in your favorite
    browser, if your provider isn't too restricted everything should run quiet
    smoothly, however you may see some errors message, in a such case to resolve
    them you'll probably have to edit config.inc.php to change some parameters
    or change directories permissions (chmod is your friend).

  - In the best case, you'll only have to edit the $admin_ip variable located
    in config.inc.php in order to be able to access the administrator account
    creation page.

  - Once it's working, lower the $debug_mode variable located in config.inc.php
    to either 0 or 1 and enjoy !
    
    If you've unresovable problems, then go to http://phpgraphy.sourceforge.net
    and follow the link to get help !

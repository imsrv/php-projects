First of all sorry for my english :-)

I think that the largest problem  you can found in piFAQ is to redesign it. 
Someone can ask: "when i open up the edit.php in textpad it doesn't have any html in it". 
Well it is true. There is no html in php files, Because piFAQ use FastTemplate (templates helps to separate program code from html).
And because of that templates it's even more easy to redesign script then in simple php and html file.

You just need to edit files  in the "tpl" directory. Lets look at them.
(NOTE: don't edit data which are in "{" "}" quotes).

index.tpl - This is a base of your design there you can edit bgcolor of page etc.
body.tpl this is a table that you can see at faq.php (don't touch the comments FastTemplate use it to found dynamic blocks).
edit.tpl - table that you can see at edit.php (also don't touch the comments).
login.tpl - Login form where program asks you to enter login and password.
addq.tpl - Adding question form.
error.tpl - better don't touch it :-)
copy.tpl - CopyLeft at the bottom of page (you can add there your Copy left, counters etc).

So as you can see you don't need to understand how FastTemplate works but if you wont to, read about it here http://www.thewebmasters.net/php/FastTemplate.phtml or here http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/PHP/PHPFastTemplate/print.

Well that's it. If you still have a questions email me pavel_i@yahoo.com.

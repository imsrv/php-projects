WELCOME

piFAQ is a simple script that will help you to create (and manage) FAQ page on your site. It is based on PHP, MySQL and FastTemplate so it's fast and easy in configuration.

INSTALL
YOU NEED - PHP (I use PHP Version 4.0.6)
         - MySQL (I use MySQL 3.23.41
         - FastTemplate (class.fasttemplate.php)

HOW TO INSTALL
       - Copy all files into your piFAQ directory (it doesn't meter how will you call it)
       - Create MySQL database and tables (take tables from tables.sql)
       - Config piFAQ - edit config.inc.php file
       - You can edit design of pages by editing of templates (directory  "tpl/"). 
       - The main page of phpFAQ is faq.php. So, put a link to it from your page.

To install the simple document management system, simply untar the
file you downloaded (eg sdms-1.1.tar.gz) in a directory that's
accessible via your web server. Rename the result to whatever
you like.

Then make sure you have PHP 4.0 or higher and MySQL installed. PHP
must live on the web server hosts, but the MySQL server can be
anywhere (this system was tested with MySQL servers up to 20,000
km removed from the web server)

If you're satisfied you have the software you need, create the tables
required for the system by running the following command:

  mysql [-u user -p] < create_db.sql

Alternatively you may edit the file first and change any values you
like (as long as you don't modify the table names or structures).

Now the tables have been created and the system is nearly ready.

Edit the file lib/config.inc and change the mysql details if required.
You may also edit any of the other values, they're pretty much self
explanatory and have a bit of comments too.

Now point your browser at:

  http://your_webserver_address/sdms_directory/index.php

Voila, enjoy!

--
Note about decent sized documents: By default, MySQL allows you to only
upload documents up to about 1 Mb in size. If you want to change this
to something a bit more useful, start your MySQL server with the following
command line option `-O max_allowed_packet=max_size_in_bytes'.

ie: For a 16 Mb document size limit, use `-O max_allowed_packet=16777216'.

1. Better error checking for test buttons. To stop any mistakes that may arrise
   when the script is not in test mode.

2. Find way to hide full url of images and links in 404.php file. Should be 
   possible using apache ErrorDocument redirect with .htaccess file.
   
3. Hide script better so simple probes are detected from savvy spammers that 
   have heard of this script. Such as the url in 404.php file above.
   
4. Allow for both obnoxious and friendly complaint reporting to ISP. Currently 
   the script reports every instance of abuse that have multiple recipients. Our 
   views are, since the spammer is going to use our bandwidth by continuously 
   trying to abuse formmail, then they should be reported each and every 
   time. Plus this illegal activity, if successful would have sent out on 
   each report the number of e-mails in the recipient address with the hopes 
   of directing all complaints to the owner of the abused server. We know how 
   that feels, since we have received hundreds of bounces and complaints because 
   of an insecure formmail script that one of our customers had running.

   But we can see how this may be upsetting to the ISP and anyone using the script. 
   So this is on our to-do list. A poll we are going to create will determine 
   how fast this option gets done.

5. Some day learn asp for porting over to Microsoft servers. If anyone know this 
   already we would be happy for any assistance you can provide.

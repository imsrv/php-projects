template7.txt&&White&&NONE&&&&Maroon&&Olive&&Silver&&&&&&&&&&My Fabulous Website&&Welcome everyone!  Please make yourselves at home...&&This is my first paragraph!  I can write anything that I want in here!  You see my lovely picture of a flashing lightbulb nearby?  I used a Plugin for that, it is Plugin #8636 and I inserted it into the Image 1 box while editing the Body of my page.  Check out the Plugin Help when you are creating your pages to see how they work!  
&&This is my second paragraph!  I can continue what I was saying in paragraph one, or not!  You may notice that I've inserted googly eyes, which are Plugin #9743, inserted into the Image 2 box while editing the Body of my page. &&This is my third...well, you get the idea by now!  The chomping mouth is Plugin #8761 and I've inserted it into the Image 3 box while editing the Body of my page.  All of these Plugins are available in the ClipArt gallery.  We have labeled all of the ClipArt with simple four-digit codes.  All that you have to do is choose an image that you like and enter its four-digit code wherever you want that image to appear!  &&Thank you for dropping by, and remember that virtually everything on this page can be edited to your liking, so take advantage of it!PLUGIN:SIMPLESEARCHBOX&&#8636&&#9743&&#8761&&top&&guestbook.shtml&&links.shtml&&email.shtml&&poll.shtml&&forum.shtml&&index.shtml&&index.shtml&&index.shtml&&index.shtml&&index.shtml&&My Guestbook!&&My Links!&&Send me Comments!&&My Poll!&&My Discussion Forum!&&&&&&&&&&&&6&&Thanks to you, my counter just went up another notch!&&&&TRUE&&TRUE

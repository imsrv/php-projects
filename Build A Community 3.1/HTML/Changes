   Release 2.21

   HTML::TokeParser can now parse strings directly and does the
   right thing if you pass it a GLOB.  Based on patch by
   Sami Itkonen <si@iki.fi>.

   comments.  Patch by Peter Orbaek <poe@daimi.au.dk>.

   Release 2.19

   Don't end a text chunk with space when we try to avoid breaking up
   words.



1998-06-22   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.18

   HTML::HeadParser->parse_file will now stop parsing when the
   <body> starts as it should.

   HTML::LinkExtor more easily subclassable by introducing the
   $self->_found_link method.



1998-04-28   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.17

   Never split words (a sequence of non-space) between two invocations
   of $self->text.  This is just a simplification of the code that tried
   not to break entities.
   
   HTML::Parser->parse_file now use smaller chunks as already
   suggested by the HTML::Parser documentation.



1998-04-02   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.16
   
   The HTML::Parser could some times break hex entites (like &#xFFFF;)
   in the middle.

   Removed remaining forced dependencies on libwww-perl modules.  It
   means that all tests should now pass, even if libwww-perl was not
   installed previously.

   More tests.



1998-04-01   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.14, HTML::* modules unbundled from libwww-perl-5.22.

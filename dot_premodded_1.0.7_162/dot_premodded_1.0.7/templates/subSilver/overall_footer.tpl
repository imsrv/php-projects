      You also may NOT delete the .premodded prohect copyright, you will lose support!
      The phpBB Group and the .premodded project won't give you support if you remove the copyright!
      Remember that modding this also took a lot of time to do this (there are more than 70/80 mods pre-installed by the .premodded project).
      So please let the copyright there where it is now, so other people know our site and we can give you better support.

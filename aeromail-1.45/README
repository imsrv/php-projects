AeroMail 1.45

----------
 Overview
----------

AeroMail is a web-based e-mail client written in PHP. AeroMail uses an IMAP server to read and store messages in one or more user-defined folders. Features include HTTP authentication for login (no cookies) and folder manipulation.

--------------
 Requirements
--------------

Apache, PHP (has to be running as a module), the IMAP functions must be compiled into PHP, an IMAP server.  Information about Apache, PHP, and compiling IMAP support into PHP can be found at one of the following URL's

http://www.apache.org/
http://www.php.net/

--------------
 Installation
--------------

Unpack the AeroMail package (.tar.gz or .zip file) into a directory within your web server.  Modify the config.inc file to suit the needs of your individual server, and simply access index.php from a web browser.  The username and password pair are your IMAP username and password.  Themes in the themes/ directory can be generated by hand, or by accessing the file color.html with Internet Explorer 5 (don't blame me, I use whatever works, and IE has a better DOM).

To enable support for sendmail to specify the e-mail address when sending, enable genericstable support in sendmail, and set the variable $FORCE_FROM to 0.  This will let sendmail specify the user and domain as specified in the genericstable file.  This is useful if you are hosting mail for more than one domain from the same system and want your user's full name to appear in the From: line of e-mails being sent.

 Common Problems
-----------------

Q:  I'm getting the error:

    "Fatal error: Call to unsupported or undefined function imap_open()
     in global.inc on line xx"

A:  You haven't compiled IMAP support into PHP.  See http://www.php.net/manual/ref.imap.php3


Q:  I'm getting an error about a wrong parameter count in the action.php3 file.  I'm running PHP 3.0.15.

A:  Add a third blank parameter to the imap_delete function on line 20.  It will look like this:

    imap_delete($mailbox, $msglist[$i], "");

# user.cfg

# This file contains all of the user-configurable variables, with the exception
# that you need to set two variables at the beginning of the classifieds.cgi file.
# Most of these variables are in the following format:

# $variable = "value";

# The # symbol will not be in front of the actual variables, however, as this
# is used to "comment out" lines in Perl.  In other words, lines that begin with
# the # symbol are ignored by Perl when it executes the program.  The $ sign
# is used to indicate variables in Perl, while the items in between the quotation
# marks represent the assigned value of that variable.  The semicolon indicates
# the end of the statement.  Therefore, in the example above, if you wanted to
# change the value for that variable, the only thing that you should change is
# the portion in between the quotation marks. For example, to change the value
# of the variable $variable to "red", you would edit it as follows:

# $variable = "red";

# Again, you would not put the # symbol in front of $variable.  We did that
# here only because this is an example that we do not want the program to 
# actually execute.

# Two other things you should note are that if you use quotation marks as part
# of the value (in other words, inside of the quotation marks that define the
# value), then you must "comment them out" by putting a back slash symbol (the
# "\" symbol) in front of them.  For example:

# $variable = "The \"red\" light";

# Also, if you use the @ symbol in any of your value statements, you must
# similarly comment it out by putting a backslash symbol in front of it,
# such as in the following:

# $my_email_address = "me\@mydomain.com";

# The variables are defined below.

########################################################################

# $mail_program should be set to the correct mail program for your server.
# There are only four valid values here:
# "sendmail" indicates that you are running on a Unix server and that you
# will be using the Unix Sendmail program.
# "blat" indicates that you are running on a Windows NT server and that you
# will be using the Blat mail program (we've tested this using Blat 1.4).
# If you are unfamiliar with this program,
# Blat is a freeware e-mail program that runs on Windows NT servers and performs
# a similar function to the UNIX sendmail program.  More information on Blat is
# available at "http://gepasi.dbs.aber.ac.uk/softw/Blat.html".
# "windmail" indicates that you are running on a Windows NT server and that
# you will be using the Windmail program (we've tested this using Windmail 3.0).
# If you are unfamiliar with this program, Windmail is a commercial e-mail
# program that runs on Windows NT servers and performs a similar function
# to the Unix Sendmail program.  Windmail is made by GeoCel, and more information
# is available at "http://www.geocel.com/".
# "smtp" indicates that you want to use the sockets-based e-mail subroutines.
# These can be used on either Unix or Windows NT web servers, provided that you
# have an SMTP mail server and that you have properly specified it in the
# $location_of_mail_program variable below.

$mail_program = "sendmail";

# $location_of_mail_program should be set to the full server path to the
# mail program that you defined above in the $mail_program variable.
# For sendmail, common locations include "/usr/lib/sendmail" or "/usr/sbin/sendmail",
# but it could be located somewhere else, depending on your server.
# If you don't know the location of sendmail on your Unix server, you might
# try typing "whereis sendmail" or "which sendmail" from a Telnet prompt.
# For Blat, this may be "c:/blat/blat.exe" or something else. For Windmail,
# this may be "c:/windmail/windmail.exe" or something else. Please note that
# you should use forward slashes when referencing the paths to Blat or
# Windmail on your Windows NT server.  
# The above are just examples, so you may need to contact your web hosting
# company or your system administrator to get the exact path to this program
# on your server.
# If you are using SMTP mail and have set the $mail_program variable equal to
# "smtp", then you should set the $location_of_mail_program variable equal to the
# domain name of your SMTP server, such as "yourdomain.com" or "smtp.yourdomain.com"
# If you see the "Can't connect socket" error message after certain operations,
# or if you aren't receiving e-mail from the program, this means that the value
# that you have specified below is incorrect.
# Also, make sure that you have the correct permissions to execute the
# designated mail program in the location that you specify below.

$location_of_mail_program = "/usr/sbin/sendmail";

# If you are using the Unix Sendmail program, you have the option of
# telling sendmail not to use the alias list for the Unix server.  This is a
# security measure to keep outsiders from using the alias list of the web
# server.  Thus, in most cases, you will want to leave this set equal to "on".
# If your e-mail address is being aliased on the server, however, then you will
# need to set this equal to "" in order to allow aliasing.

$block_sendmail_aliasing = "on";

# If you are having problems with certain routines (such as posting, modifying, or
# deleting ads), this could be because your server does not allow outgoing e-mail
# messages to have a FROM address of anyone other than a user that is known to the
# server.  If the administrative e-mail address that you are using for this program
# is known to the server, you can try setting the following variable equal to "on",
# and this may fix the problem.  If your server is extremely picky, however, it
# won't fix the problem, and you will have to disable e-mailing for these routines
# or even for the entire program.  In such cases, you should contact your web hosting
# company or server administrator about relaxing these overly strict server limitations.

$require_admin_from_address = "";

# The following variable will disable all e-mailing by the program.  Normally, you
# would leave this set to "", but if you are having problems installing the program

# you want to screen new ads before allowing them into your system, or if you
# want to temporarily block a spammer from flooding your system with lots of
# junk ads.  The downside is that you will have to screen the new ads quite often,

# the last section of digits.  If so, this strategy will block their access because
# the program checks to see if the combination that you specify here appears

# Please keep in mind that censoring out "bad words" is far from an exact science,

# $use_builtin_warn should be set to "on" only if you are not using the separate

# send out the warning notices and that you leave the $use_builtin_warn variable
# here set to "".  This is because the builtin version
# will cause additional server overhead and may not run at the exact time periods
# that you like because it is dependent on user actions (it can run only when
# the program is actually being used).  As a result, some of your users may not
# receive warning notices before their ads expire.  Therefore, you should set

# The following variable sets the minimum number of days before each
# user's ad is about to expire that the program should send this user the e-mail
# notice warning him or her of the ad's imminent expiration.  If you are able to run
# the "warn" program daily (either as a cron job, manually, or because your site
# gets enough traffic that the classifieds program will be run in each section
# on each day so that
# the built-in warn program for that section is run each day) and thus have set
# the $warn_runtime_interval variable
# below equal to "1" (very strongly recommended), then all of your users will
# receive this warning notice
# exactly on the number of days before the ad expires that you specify here.
# Otherwise, if you are not able to run the program daily, some users may
# receive this notice even sooner (giving them
# a greater number of warning days).  This is because the program needs to
# adjust for the fact that the warning program is not being run daily in order to
# ensure that all users are warned before their ads expire and that no user receives
# more than one such warning.  It makes this adjustment by sending warning notices
# to all users whose ads will expire in at least $minimum_warning_days days and
# not more than ($minimum_warning_days + ($warn_runtime_interval -1)) days.
# Please keep in mind, however, that even with this adjustment, if the program is
# not run on a regular, periodic basis (this means exactly every 3 days, 7 days,
# or some other interval) either through a cron job or manually,
# some of your users may not receive warning notices before their ads expire.  This
# is extremely likely if you are relying on the built-in warn program, because if
# your classifieds program isn't being run every day, the warn
# program will not run on those days when your classifieds site gets no traffic.
# If you find all of this confusing, the best setup is to run the separate

MWCHAT UTILITIES
==================

This document contains instructions for using the MWChat utilities.

For information on the capabilities and features of MWChat, see
the file README in the docs/ directory of the MWChat
distribution.


UTILITY: Users online
---------------------

MWChat provides a utility that you can easily configure and add to your site.
This utility will display how many users are online chatting in your MWChat system.

Edit the file mwchat/utilities/users.php and modify the $CONFIG[MWChat_Root] variable to
reflect where the root of your mwchat installation is. Once you've done this, you can 
simply include this file in your website PHP pages.

EX: <?PHP include("/path/to/mwchat/utilities/users.php"); ?>


This will then display the number of current users in MWChat.

==================
INSTALLING MWCHAT
==================

This document contains instructions for installing the MWChat
software on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of MWChat, see
the file README in the docs/ directory of the MWChat
distribution.


OBTAINING MWChat
----------------

The MWChat software can be obtained from the Appindex.Net website at

   http://www.appindex.net/


LICENSING MWChat
----------------

In order to use MWChat, you must get a serial number for the software.
You can get a serial number for MWChat and other products at

   http://www.appindex.net/products/

To get a serial number, you will need your webserver's IP address, which
can be obtained from a phpinfo() call on a PHP page 
(http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.phpinfo.php). We have provided a phpinfo
page located in the mwchat/docs directory. You can access that page at

    http://yourhost/mwchat/docs/php-info.php

See the install directions below for information on where you installed MWChat.

Once you have that you'll need to decided what type of license you would like.

The "basic" license for MWChat is completely free. This will allow you to run 
MWChat on your site, and with most functionality included. With the basic license
you will also receive unlimited free email support. Upgrading at any time is also
no cost to you. The basic version doesn't contain buddy lists, or registered users.
There are also some features that require users to be registered to use, things like
file sharing, and preferences are also unavailable if you choose the basic license.


The "pro" license for MWChat allows you and your users to take full advantage of
MWChat abilities. If you purchase the pro license you will also receive unlimited 
email support, but you will get a higher priority level of service because you've
purchased the software. You can find out about the pricing for the pro license at 
our website

   http://www.appindex.net/products/detail/?product=mwchat


Now that you've decided on a license your ready to go. Read on for a list of system
prerequisites and installtion instructions.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

The following prerequisites are REQUIRED for MWChat to function
properly.

  1. A webserver that supports PHP.
                                   
     MWChat is developed under the Apache webserver, which we recommend. 
     Apache is available from  

        http://www.apache.org/
                              
  2. PHP 4.2.1 or above.
                        
     PHP is the interpreted language in which MWChat is written.
     You can obtain PHP at                                     

        http://www.php.net/
                           
     Follow the instructions in the PHP package to build PHP
     for your system. If you use Apache, be sure to build PHP
     as a library with the                                   

         --with-apache
     or               
         --with-apxs
                    
     options to ./configure, and not as a stand alone executable.
                                                                
     NOTE: MWChat makes use of some of PHP's latest functions.
     Because of this we require a a later version of PHP as 
     described above. You MUST have register_globals enabled
     in your php.ini file to function correctly. Later versions
     of MWChat will correct this.

The following PHP prerequisites are RECOMMENDED, or are REQUIRED
if you use a specific MWChat feature (as noted in [brackets]):

  1. Mcrypt support (--with-mcrypt)

     Mcrypt is a general-purpose cryptography library which is
     broader and more efficient than PHP's own cryptographic
     code. You can obtain mcrypt from

         http://mcrypt.hellug.gr/

     Building PHP without mcrypt support will not stop MWChat
     from working, but you will not be able to use [Database Encryption]

     This feature, for added security is recommended, but again it is not
     required.


INSTALLING MWChat
----------------

MWChat is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible
directory. The precise location of this directory will differ from
system to system. If you have no idea where you should be installing
MWChat, install it directly under the root of your webserver's document
tree.

Since MWChat is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary;
simply expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename
the root directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear
in the URL. For example, with the Apache webserver's default document
root of '/usr/local/apache/htdocs', you would type:

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs
   tar zxvf /path/to/mwchat-x.x.tar.gz
   mv mwchat-x.x mwchat

   (note that x.x will be the latest version number.)

and would then find MWChat at the URL

   http://your-server/mwchat/



CONFIGURING MWChat
-----------------

1. Configuring the web server

   MWChat requires the following webserver settings. Examples shown are
   for Apache; other webservers' configurations will differ.

   a. PHP interpretation for files matching "*.php"

         AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

   b. "index.php" as an index file (brought up when a user requests
      a URL for a directory)                                       

         DirectoryIndex index.php

2. Creating databases

   The specific steps to create a preferences storage container depend
   on which database you've chosen to use. At the time of this writing
   MWChat only supports MySQL.

   First, you will need to create a user and password for MWChat to use.
   Once you created these, you will need to create a database for MWChat's
   data. You may use any names you like for this information, but we recommend
   keeping it all MWChat related to keep things clear and simple.
   You can find information for adding users and databases at

        http://www.mysql.com/documentation/
        http://www.oracle.com/
        http://www.postgres.com/
        http://www.sybase.com/home

3. Configuring MWChat

   To configure MWChat, change to the mwchat/config/ directory of the
   installed distribution.

   Documentation on the format of those files can be found in each
   file. You must at least complete the configuration of system.php
   and database.php and provide db information and paths to MWChat.

   You must also edit license.php and enter your license information.

   Each configuration file has information on each feature and how 
   it works with MWChat.

   NOTE: The system by default is not live untill you enable it in the
   system.php config file.

   The other files in that directory need only be modified if you wish
   to customize MWChat's appearance or behavior -- the defaults will
   work at most sites.

   
   All of the default file permissions on MWChat are 644. This should
   be ok for most systems. MWChat has the ability to do file sharing 
   for registered users. If you wish to take advantage of this feature,
   the mwchat/files directory *must* be writable by the webserver.

   We do not recommend you put 0777 permissions on it. Instead chown
   that directory to the owner of the webserver and use 0755 permissions
   or something similar. Because webserver configurations differ, you 
   should contact your system administrator for more help on writable
   directory permissions.


4. Securing MWChat

   a. Passwords
               
      Some of MWChat's configuration files contain passwords which local
      users could use to access your database. It is recommended to ensure
      that at least the MWChat configuration files (in config/) are not    
      readable to system users. There are .htaccess files restricting 
      access to directories that do not need to be accessed directly;
      before relying on those, ensure that your webserver supports   
      .htaccess and is configured to use them, and that the files in
      those directories are in fact inaccessible via the browser.   
                                                                 
      An additional approach is to make MWChat's configuration files
      owned by the user 'root' and by a group which only the webserver
      user belongs to, and then making them readable only to owner and
      group. For example, if your webserver runs as www.www, do as    
      follows:                                                    
              
         chown root.www config/*
         chmod 0440 config/*


5. Testing MWChat
       
   Once you have configured your webserver, PHP, and MWChat, bring up the
   included license page in your Web browser to ensure that all necessary
   prerequisites have been met. If you installed MWChat as described
   above, the URL to the test page would be

      http://your-server/mwchat/license.php

   Check to ensure that you see no errors on this page (this includes PHP
   errors). If you do see errors, consult the FAQ at 

       http://www.appindex.net/products/faq/?product=mwchat

   If all looks well, enter the serial number you received in the text field
   on this page. If you have not yet received your serial number, go ahead 
   and get one.

   NOTE: You will need a serial number for both the basic and pro installations.

   Serial numbers for a basic license are free and can be obtained from

     
       http://www.appindex.net/products/


   Go ahead and click "Retrieve Licenses" and MWChat will automatically download
   and install it's licenses.

   From here on out, you should have a working version. Be sure to put your serial
   number into the mwchat/config/license.php file as your licenses will NOT work
   until you do.

   This file, license.php is perfectly safe and no one will be able to retrieve 
   or update your licenses without your serial number, so keep it safe!

   (Your serial number is also available online at http://www.appindex.net/my)

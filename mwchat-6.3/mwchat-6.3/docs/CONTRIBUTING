MWChat is developed and maintained by a private corporation. While the code is viewable, it is considered
closed-source as modifications by third parties are against our license policy.

While you may not directly send patches of code to us, you can send us suggestions. We are ready to add
new features or changes that will help to make MWChat more useful to you. Our turn around time for releases
is very good and we'd love to hear from you.

MWChat does need help with translations. Currently MWChat is only ported to 7 languages, and we would love
to see that number grow!

If you'd like to help create MWChat translations, please let us know. You will receive full credit for the 
translation. If you've translated MWChat, please send us your work! We can then add it to our tree so that 
everyone may benefit from your help, and it will save you time as you won't have to install your own translations
each time you upgrade. Please be sure to include your name and email so we can give proper credit.

Please see the file docs/TRANSLATIONS for more information on creating new translations.

In any case, MWChat wouldn't be what it is today if it wasn't for the large amounts of people using it.

Thanks for the extreme interest in our product. We hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoy creating it.

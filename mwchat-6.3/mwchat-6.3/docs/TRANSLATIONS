Thank you helping us with translations.!!


To create your translation change directory in the locales directory.

> cd mwchat/locales

In this directory you will see a directory called "en". This abbreviation 
stands for "English" and is the MASTER copy of our current language set.

IMPORTANT NOTE: 

 Do NOT translate a language from any other existing directory other than "en".
 If you do, you may be translating out of date text.


Copy the "en" directory to the abbreviation of your new language, ex "es" - Spanish.

> cp -a en es

Change into the new "es" directory and begin editing each file. While we appreciate your
help in translating MWChat, please do not send us partial translations. You may however send
us corrections for bad translations.

In each file, you will see entries like the one below:

$LOCALE[Name] = "Choose a preferred name";

To translate this line, you would do:

$LOCALE[Name] = "Elija un nombre preferido";

Make sure you translate ONLY the text in quotes. After you have completed all files in this directory, 
your translations are complete. You can now add them to MWChat.

In your MWChat config directory, edit the file locales.php. Read down that file for instructions on adding 
your translation so that it will appear into MWChat.


You can send use your translations via email at: support@appindex.net, be sure to include your name and email
so we can give you due credit.


Thanks for help!

If you are upgrading MWChat, or for some odd reason need to change licenses, you 
can do so simply by entering your NEW serial number into the license screen.

If you've upgraded MWChat, you should have gotten a new serial number, if you didn't you 
will need to re-apply and get a new serial number.

Once you have your new serial number, go to:

http://yourhost/mwchat/license.php

Enter your new serial number and MWChat will re-license your software.

If your serial number has changed, make sure you put your new serial number into mwchat/config/license.php

If you have further questions concerning software licensing, see the README file.

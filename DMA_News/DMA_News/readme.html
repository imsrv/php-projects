<span class="gentle_warning_title">Note</span>
<br><br>
<span class="gentle_warning">Throughout this document [ and ] are used instead of < and > tags for the 
purposes of display in this HTML file only. We've found this preferable to using code tags as it gives 
more readable output in most browsers.</span>
<br><br><br>

<span class="subtitle">Installation</span>
<br><br>

<ol>
	<li>
		Place all the scripts in a separate folder on your webserver.
	</li>
	<li>
		Open "dma_news_admin.php" in a text editor and enter your MySQL database configuration 
		information in the config section at the top. (You can use either a new database or an 
		existing database, all the tables that are created are prefixed with "dma_news" and will not 
		overwrite anything in an existing database.)
	</li>
	<li>
		Open "dma_news_display.php" in a text editor and enter exactly the same information.
	</li>
	<li>
		CHMOD the scripts  to something reasonable, such as 644, and protect the directory 
		with .htaccess for security purposes. DMANews may get its own login routines in the future, 
		but for the time being please ensure your own security.
	</li>
	<li>
		Open a browser and run "dma_news_admin.php".
	</li>
	<li>
		When run for the first time, the script will attempt to configure the selected database, 
		simply follow the instructions on screen. As long as you have followed these instructions 
		carefully you should get a list of successful upload reports followed by a link back into 
		the script.
	</li>
	<li>
		Hopefully use of the script itself is self explanatory.
	</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
 

<span class="subtitle">Templates</span>
<br><br>

<span class="subsubtitle">Admin Template</span>
<br><br>

You can use this to integrate the admin control panel (dma_news_admin.php) into the design 
of the rest of your site. Simply enter all the HTML code that you want to use and insert 
XXX_CONTENT_XXX where you want the admin control panel to appear. The script then places the 
control panel within the template when the page is called (where you specified with 
XXX_CONTENT_XXX).
<br><br>

<span class="subsubtitle">News Article Header</span>
<br>
<span class="subsubtitle">News Article Template</span>
<br>
<span class="subsubtitle">News Article Footer</span>
<br><br>

This is where you specify the design of the news articles as they are output to visitors 
to your website. "News Article Header" appears once above the whole block of articles, 
"News Article Template" governs the look of each article and "News Article Footer" appears 
once at the bottom of the whole block of articles.
<br><br>

For example, if you have three news articles, the templates are called as follows ...
<br><br>

<table bgcolor="#ffffff" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="">
	<tr>
		<td>News Article Header</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>News Article Template<br>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>News Article Template<br>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>News Article Template<br>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>News Article Footer<br>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>

"News Article Header" and "News Article Footer" are there primarily for use with tables 
(as [table] and [/table] respectively), but no doubt they can be used for other things such 
as copyright info.
<br><br>

Here's a better example of the table idea ...
<br><br>

<table bgcolor="#ffffff" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="">
	<tr>
		<td>(News Article Header)</td>
		<td>[table]</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>(News Article Template)</td>
		<td>[tr] [td] XXX_NEWS_XXX [/td] [/tr]</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>(News Article Template)</td>
		<td>[tr] [td] XXX_NEWS_XXX [/td] [/tr]</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>(News Article Template)</td>
		<td>[tr] [td] XXX_NEWS_XXX [/td] [/tr]</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>(News Article Footer)</td>
		<td>[/table]</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<br><br>

<span class="gentle_warning_title">IMPORTANT!</span>
<br><br>
<span class="gentle_warning">DMA News uses the following markers within "News Article Template" 
to insert information from the database ...</span>
<br><br>

<table bgcolor="#ffffff" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="">
	<tr>
		<td>
			XXX_NEWS_XXX
		</td>
		<td>
			is replaced with the actual news
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			XXX_TIME_XXX
		</td>
		<td>
			is replaced with the time the article was written
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			XXX_AUTHOR_XXX
		</td>
		<td>
			is replaced with the author of the article
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			XXX_ALTCOLOR_XXX
		</td>
		<td>
			is replaced with once of the two alternating colors specified in the "Configure colors" 
             section of the admin script.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<br><br>

Example:<br><br>

<table bgcolor="#ffffff" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="">
	<tr>
		<td>
			[tr bgcolor="#XXX_ALTCOLOR_XXX"]
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			[td align="left"]XXX_TIME_XXX[/td]
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			[/tr]
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			[tr bgcolor="#XXX_ALTCOLOR_XXX"]
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			[td align="left"]XXX_NEWS_XXX[/td]
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			[/tr]
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			[tr bgcolor="#XXX_ALTCOLOR_XXX"]
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			[td align="right"]XXX_AUTHOR_XXX[/td]
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			[/tr]
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br><br>

Note that XXX_ALTCOLOR_XXX changes between articles, not WITHIN articles. This means that in the example 
above, the same color is used three times, in the next article however, the other alt color will be used 
three times.
<br><br>

You don't need to use all the markers, you may not be using tables, in which case you probably won't use 
XXX_ALTCOLOR_XXX in your templates. Likewise, if you don't want to add the authors name, don't put it in 
the template.

<span class="subtitle">Displaying the news on your site in a PHP script</span>

Call "dma_news_display.php" as an include or require.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
include ("./DMA_News/dma_news_display.php");

These instructions assume that you have the following working
together: Web Server, PHP, and database. I recommend the
following configuration:

- Apache Web Server (http://www.apache.org/). I recommend downloading
the source and compiling it yourself so that you can compile PHP as
an Apache module. NOTE: The RPM or other binary version should work
as well.

- PHP (http://www.php.net/). Again I recommend downloading the source
and compiling it yourself so that you can compile PHP as an Apache
module. NOTE: phpop should also work using PHP as a CGI
executable either compiled yourself or from a binary distribution of
PHP.

- MySQL (http://www.mysql.net/). You can either compile the source,
or in my case I downloaded the binary RPMs from the MySQL website.
Either should work.

phpop installation
(after untar/unzip the distribution file to a temporary location...)

1. Move the phpop directory that was created by the un-tar/un-zip to
a location under your webserver's document root - so that the
web server will serve the phpop directory and pages.

2. There is more than one method for setting up the PHP include
path. My prefferred method is to use the .htaccess file in 
phpop/ to set the PHP include path to ".:./lib:./lib/phplib".
This lets me keep all phpop files under a single directory structure.

3. Tell your webserver NOT TO SERVE pages in the phpop/lib directory.
These pages contain the user ID and password to your database and
you don't want folks seeing them. I have included an .htaccess
file in this directory for use by Apache that will stop browsing
of the lib directory. Make sure and test this after the installation
by trying to get to http://your-domain.com/phpop/lib/poplocal.inc
You should NOT be able to get to this URL.

4. Create a database for phpop (e.g., "phpop"), then 
create the tables in the database used by phpop
using the phpop.sql definition. In MySQL this can be done
(assuming you have created a database named "phpop") with the
following command:
  mysql phpop <create_db.mysql

5. Update the poplocal.inc file with the name of your phpop
database and the user ID and password used to connect to it. I use
"phpop" as the name of my phpop database. Review the
contents of this file and update to support the database you are
using.

6. Update the phpop.inc file with the configuration settings
for your environment.

7. OPTIONAL: 
  Full customization is available with the FastTemplate support in phpop.
Update the files in the phpop/lib/templates directory to create the 
look & feel and language that you desire for your installation of phpop.

8. If you are running on a Windows platform, edit the
class.FastTemplate.inc file in the phpop/lib directory and change the
WIN32 variable in the class section at the top to "true"

9. To give phpop full control over character handling,
especially quotes, you must turn magic_quotes_gpc, magic_quotes_sybase 
and magic_quotes_runtime off. You can do this in the php3.ini file
or if supported by your webserver in the .htaccess file. These settings
are already set in the sample .htaccess file from the distribution.

12. Open the index.php3 page in your browser, enter your POP user ID
in the user ID field (normally your email user), enter your POP password
in the password field, click "Login" button, and enjoy!

Welcome to the YaWPS installation guide!
If you are upgrading from an older version of YaWPS, please read the UPGRADE 
file! 

...Step 1: CHECKING REQUIREMENTS
You'll need some webspace that has Perl5 or higher enabled. 
If you are unsure, please contact your web host. 
You'll need a web browser (IE4.5+ or NN4.5+) and a FTP client to upload the 
files.
You'll also need your path to perl, it's usually "/usr/bin/perl". 
If you are unsure ask your administrator.

...Step 2: GETTING STARTED
Fire up your FTP client and look for a cgi-bin directory on your server. 
Here are a few examples of what you might see. 
Please find the one closest to your directory structure:
+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
|                     |                     |                     |
|       cgi-bin       |       cgi-bin       |     cgi-bin         |
|       www           |       httpdocs      |     public_html     |
|                     |                     |                     |
+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
|                     |                     |                     |
| public_html/cgi-bin |     www/cgi-bin     |       cgi-bin       |
|                     |                     |                     |
|                     |                     |                     |
+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
If you do not see a cgi-bin, or a folder named cgi or something similar, 
then you will need to make one, as long as you know your host supports cgi. 
Create the folder and chmod it to 755.
Please Note : Windows servers do not accept chmod values. 
The steps discussing chmod may be skipped if your site is hosted on a Windows 
server.

...Step 3: SETTING UP THE CGI DIRECTORIES
In your server's cgi-bin directory create a directory called 'yawps'. 
Upload the entire local YaWPS cgi-bin directory.
You should now have the following directory structure:
cgi-bin/yawps/db
cgi-bin/yawps/db/blocks
cgi-bin/yawps/db/blocks/1.txt
cgi-bin/yawps/db/blocks/blocks.dat
cgi-bin/yawps/db/forum
cgi-bin/yawps/db/forum/messages
cgi-bin/yawps/db/links
cgi-bin/yawps/db/members
cgi-bin/yawps/db/members/admin.dat
cgi-bin/yawps/db/members/membergroups.dat 
cgi-bin/yawps/db/members/memberlist.dat
cgi-bin/yawps/db/modules
cgi-bin/yawps/db/pages
cgi-bin/yawps/db/polls
cgi-bin/yawps/db/stats
cgi-bin/yawps/db/topics
cgi-bin/yawps/db/topics/articles
cgi-bin/yawps/db/topics/cats.dat
cgi-bin/yawps/db/.htaccess
cgi-bin/yawps/db/welcomemsg.txt
cgi-bin/yawps/lang
cgi-bin/yawps/lang/english.pl
cgi-bin/yawps/lang/german.pl
cgi-bin/yawps/modules
cgi-bin/yawps/admin.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/forum.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/help.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/index.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/installer.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/instant_messenger.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/links.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/login.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/memberlist.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/pages.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/polls.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/recommend.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/register.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/search.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/smilies.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/stats.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/top10.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/topics.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/user.cgi
cgi-bin/yawps/yawps.pm
cgi-bin/yawps/yawpsrc.pl
Chmod all cgi-files to 755.
Check the perl path at the first line of them.
Leave yawpsrc.pl chmoded to 644.
Chmod all files and directories inside the db-folder to 777.
Leave .htaccess chmoded to 644.
Remove all dummy files inside the db directory.

...Step 4: SETTING UP THE NON-CGI DIRECTORY
In the 'public' part of your web space - usually the directory is called 
'public', 'public_html', 'www' - create another directory called 'yawps' 
and in that new directory, upload the local non-cgi folder.
You should now have the following directory structure:
public-html/yawps/yawpsnews.xml
public-html/yawps/images
public-html/yawps/images/avatars
public-html/yawps/images/avatars/_nopic.gif
public-html/yawps/images/avatars/index.html

Make sure that these files are accessible from everywhere! 
Chmod yawpsnews.xml to 666.

...Step 5: SET UP YAWPSRC.PL
Open yawpsrc.pl (in the YaWPS cgi-bin folder) and edit the global variables:
$cfg{pagename} 
$cfg{pagetitle}
Enter the absolute path for the following variables:
$cfg{cgi_bin_dir}
$cfg{non_cgi_dir}
You can run the test.cgi script from the TOOLS directory to determine your
path to YaWPS (copy test.cgi into the directory where your YaWPS cgi files 
reside).
Enter the correct URL for the following variables:
$cfg{cgi_bin_url}
$cfg{non_cgi_url}
Enter your email address for $cfg{webmaster_email}.

...Step 6: LOGIN TO YaWPS
You should then be able to log in as site administrator. 
Login using "admin" as username and "yawps" as password. 
Edit the admin profile (i.e. change the admin password!).

If you have any problems, please check out the manuals at 
http://yawps.sourceforge.net/ for further instructions.

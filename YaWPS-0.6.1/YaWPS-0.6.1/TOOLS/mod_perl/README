If you want to run YaWPS under mod_perl you will need to follow these 
instructions. 
Note that these instructions are for the Apache webserver ONLY!

...Step 1:
Edit the startup.pl file. You will need to change line 13 that says 
use lib qw(/var/www/perl/yawps);
/var/www/perl/yawps needs to be changed to the path of your YaWPS installation.

...Step 2:
Depending on your Apache configuration edit perl.conf (or srm.conf or even 
httpd.conf) and add the following line to the section that enables the perl 
module:
PerlRequire /var/www/perl/yawps/mod_perl/startup.pl
You may need to change the above line depending on the path of your YaWPS 
installation.

...Step 3:
Make sure all your scripts are in the directory that runs under mod_perl.

...Step 4:
Restart httpd and you should be ready to rumble.

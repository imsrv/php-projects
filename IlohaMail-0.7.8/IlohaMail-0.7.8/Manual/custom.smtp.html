<html><head><title>Custom SMTP</title></head><body><center><h2>Custom SMTP</h2></center><blockquote>	<p>IlohaMail 0.7.8 includes a <i>development</i> version of a custom SMTP library.  This library replaces the <tt>mail()</tt> function built into PHP.	<p><h2>Features</h2>	<ul>		<li><b>Low memory useage</b> - Unlike the built in function, which requires the entire message to be stored in memory, the custom SMTP library allows messages to be streamed, thus requiring very little memory even when sending extremely large messages.		<li><b>Support for external SMTP servers</b> - With the custom SMTP library, messages can be sent through an external SMTP server.  This allows for improved scalability and flexibility.		<li><b>Improved Windows support</b> - Unlike the built in mail function (in PHP < 4.3), the custom SMTP library has full SMTP functionality on any Windows server with SMTP support.	</ul>	<p><h2>Requirements</h2>	<blockquote>	All you need is an <b>SMTP server</b>, either installed locally or on a remote server.  It must allow SMTP relaying from the machine IlohaMail is installed on. 	</blockquote>		<p><h2>Installation</h2>	<blockquote>	To activate the custom SMTP library, change the name of source/compose.php to something like source/compose.old.php, then rename source/compose2.php to source/compose.php.  Please note that the custom SMTP library is still considered to be in development, and has not undergone extensive testing.	</blockquote>	</blockquote></body></html>

INSTALL
Modified: 9/8/2002

Introduction
============
This document assumes you're running Apache, and have PHP4 (v 4.1.2 or
later) installed.  If you are running a version of PHP earlier than 4.1.2,
you are STRONGLY encouraged to upgrade.

An html version of this file is available in the Manual directory, as
well as the online documentation engine <http://ilohamail.org/docs/>.

This document will walk you through the steps necessary to setup 
IlohaMail with a file-based backend.  It is possible to setup IlohaMail
with a MySQL-backend, which is recommended for larger installations.
For differences between the two backends, see the FAQ available at:
http://ilohamail.org/docs/view.php?id=47


Updating
========
See the file UPGRADING for more information on updating older versions.


Installation
============

1) Download and unpack the tar ball, cd into the IlohaMail directory.
	e.g.
	$tar xzf IlohaMail-version.tar.gz
	$cd IlohaMail-version

2) Move the IlohaMail directory to any location on your hard drive OUTSIDE
your Apache document root.
	e.g.
	$mv IlohaMail /www/IlohaMail

3) Add an "Alias" directive in your httpd.conf file, and point it to the
IlohaMail/source directory.
	e.g.
	Alias /webmail /usr/local/apache/IlohaMail/source

3b.  If you do not have access to the httpd.conf file, you may also create
a symbolic link in your document root.
	e.g.
	$ln -s /www/IlohaMail/source {$DOCUMENT_ROOT}/webmail

4) Create necessary directories inside IlohaMail/
	NOTE:
		The directories you need to create differ depending on your desired
		configuration.
		In all the following steps, ignore folders that you don't need. 
	You need:
		users:  Needed for file based backend only
		sessions: Needed for file based backend only
		uploads: Needed to support sending attachments
		cache: Needed ONLY if POP3 caching is to be enabled
	e.g.
	$mkdir /www/IlohaMail/users
	$mkdir /www/IlohaMail/sessions
	$mkdir /www/IlohaMail/uploads
	$mkdir /www/IlohaMail/cache

5) Change access privileges so only the web server has access to those
directories
	e.g.
	$chmod 700 /www/IlohaMail/users
	$chmod 700 /www/IlohaMail/sessions
	$chmod 700 /www/IlohaMail/uploads
	$chmod 700 /www/IlohaMail/cache

NOTE: If you have PHP installed as a CGI module, or you do not have root
access, you may need to change permissions to 777.

6) Change the owner of the folders you created in step 4 to the user Apache
is running as (look for the "User" directive in httpd.conf if you're not
sure).
You will need root access for this step (change the privileges to 777 and
skip this step if you don't have root access).
	e.g.
	$chown nobody /www/IlohaMail/users
	$chown nobody /www/IlohaMail/sessions
	$chown nobody /www/IlohaMail/uploads
	$chown nobody /www/IlohaMail/cache

7) Restart Apache, and try accessing the program.  If it works, give your
self a pat on the back.

8) Please read the manual for information on various configuration 
options, as well as the optional MySQL backend.

SiteBar 3 Install & Upgrade Guide
=================================

1) Move the content of the installation package to a place  accessible  to  your
HTTP server (let's assume it will be accessible as http://localhost/sitebar).

2) Open page http://localhost/sitebar/sitebar.php and  let  yourself  be  guided
through the rest of the installation/upgrade. The  installation  ends  with  the
message that you are welcome to SiteBar. Upgrade ends on your login screen or if
you were logged in before installation then you might still be logged (if  there
was no change in login mechanism).

Notes:
======

Installation assumes you either already have the database or have the  right  to
create it from a PHP script.

If you are upgrading from some older SiteBar 3 version (and not from the  latest
one), the installation procedure will  execute  repeatedly  upgrade  until  your
database is up-to-date.

If you had some interim development version with some database  conversion  than
it is most likely that you will receive some error messages during update. Those
messages can usually be ignored.

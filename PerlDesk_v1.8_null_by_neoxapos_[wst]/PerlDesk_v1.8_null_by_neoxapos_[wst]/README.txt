WHAT IS PERLDESK?
---------------------------------------------------------
 Perldesk is a fully featured help desk system that is an 
 ideal solution for companies with more than one staff 
 member who support several users. Main features include:
 Email submissions, staff logging, knowledge base, user
 registration, and many more. 

 It has been built with both the end-user and customer 
 support personnel in mind. End-users can submit their 
 requests via either e-mail (directly routed to the desk)
 or via the web based area - these features ensure end
 user convenience. Both methods are logged in the same
 way and can be viewed in the ticket queue and staff 
 members can view them/close/edit them.

 Staff logging is a popular feature of the desk, which 
 allows staff members to log calls and assign them 
 internally. Especially usefull for phone operators.

Thank you for purchasing PerlDesk. This document should assist with the installation
process of PerlDesk. Should you have any difficulties, please email support@perldesk.com
along with your license ID.


      - Perl / MySQL
	- The following Perl modules:

		DBI 
            DBD::MySQL
            Digest::MD5

Certain features of PerlDesk will require additional modules:

  [*] Mail::POP3Client  (Perl 5.6.1 or greater may also be required)

         This is only required if you choose to use the incoming pop email 
         utility in the admin.

  [*] MIME::Tools

         This is required if you wish to pipe email into PerlDesk (as described
         below) using the email.cgi file.



INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------

 [*] Untar the compressed file 'tar zxvf filename.tar.gz'
     Or use a utility such as WinRAR/WinZip

     By default, there are two directories in the file

     cgi-bin
     images

     The files inside the 'cgi-bin' can be placed anywhere
     where you have .cgi files enabled on your server, but
     if you put them in the actual cgi-bin you will likely
     need to store the images outside of the cgi-bin due to
     permissions.

 [*] Upload files in ASCII, and images in BINARY

 [*] Chmod all .cgi files to 755, if you plan to edit 
     the templates via the admin section, you will also
     need to make the template files writable. 777.
     (include/tpl)
                cd /path/to/perldesk
                chmod -R 755 *.cgi

 [*] Set the mysql connection settings in the conf.cgi file

 [*] You will then need to run install.cgi to setup
     the sql structure

 [*] Log in to the /admin.cgi file, 'admin/demo'

 EMAIL INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------

 [*] PerlDesk comes with the added ability to manage 
     your email communications with customers. Please
     follow these steps to set this up.

 [*] Install the Perl module MIME::Tools

 [*] Open up the include/email.cgi and edit the path to
     the config file. And the second path to the lang 
     folder

 [*] You must setup your mail software (e.g. sendmail) 
     so that emails sent to the address(es) of your 
     choice are piped through to email.cgi

 [*] If you are using SENDMAIL you must edit your 
     /etc/aliases file, and add a line similar to the 
     following:

        support: "|/path/to/perldesk/email.cgi"
  
     Repeat that line for each address you want perl
     desk to control.

 [*] If you are using EXIM, pico /etc/valiases/domain
     you will need to add the following line:

      support@domain.com: |/path/to/perldesk/email.cgi

     As with sendmail, repeat that line for each 
     address you want perldesk to manage. 

 [*] BEFORE starting to use your email addresses, you
     need to log in to the admin section of perldesk
     and go to 'Settings > Email Settings' at the 
     bottom you need to assign each address you would 
     like to use.
 
 [*] Now perldesk is setup to control your email  
     address(es) :)

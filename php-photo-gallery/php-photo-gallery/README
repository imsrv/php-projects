(1) You have just downloaded the following files:
	
	/php-photo-gallery
		/README (this file
		/photos
			/index.php
			/images

(2) Upload the 'photos' directory, and all files within it to your
	web server.

(3) Test it out: http://www.your-site.com/photos/index.php

(4) Edit the 'USER SETTINGS' in /photos/index.php
	Read the comments above each setting, as they're pretty self
	explainitory

(5) To upload new images, just add them to the '/photos/images' directory.
	Normally, you should upload 2 files for each image:
		(1) a thumbnail GIF
		(2) a larger JPG
	
	Each file should be named identically, except for the extension:
		for example: image_1.gif, image_1.jpg, image_2.gif, image_2.jpg

(6) OPTIONALLY, Add the base file name of each image pair to the the $image array, 
	defined under the 'USER SETTINGS' of /photos/index.php
		$image = array('image_1', 'image_2');




The following user settings are in /photos/index.php

	** IMAGES (array)   [OPTIONAL]
	**
	** Array of all image names in the photo gallery. For each
	** item in this array, there should be a jpg and - if $use_gifs is true
	** above - a gif.
	** 
	** There are a couple ways to do this...
	** 
	** [1] Manually create an array (without extensions)
	**     This is the least amount of work for PHP, and a little more work for you:
	** 			$image = array( "image_1", "image_2", "image_3");
	**
	** [2] Manually create an array by copying contents of the directory
	**     A little more work for PHP, easier for you:
	** 			$image = array(	"image_1.gif", "image_1.jpg", 
	** 							"image_2.gif", "image_2.jpg", 
	** 							"image_3.gif", "image_3.jpg");
	**
	** [3] Automatically read your image directory
	** 	   Most work for PHP - easiest for you:
	**			LEAVE $image undefined (comment it out or delete it)
	**
	** Gif and jpg files must be named with ".gif" and ".jpg" extenstion (with lower case extenstion names)
	**
	**/
	//$image = array( "image_1", "image_2", "image_3");

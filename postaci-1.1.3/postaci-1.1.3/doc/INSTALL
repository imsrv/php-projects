POSTACI 1.1.3 INSTALLATION
--------------------------

***********************************************************************************
SEE FAQ' s in this directory after completing setup. It also contains very important 
issues about Postaci Webmail. 

This document is for fresh installation only. If you are upgrading from a provious
version please refer to the file called UPGRADE. 
***********************************************************************************

1. Information about the program

Postaci is a PHP based POP3/IMAP based e-mail client. It can handle both protocols
and the defaul protocol can be changed from a single configuration file. Postaci is
platform independent. It can work on any operating system which PHP supports. Postaci
is also database independent. It can handle with MySQL, mSQL, Microsoft SQL, Sybase,
PostgreSQL. It uses very complicated database operations for handling with POP3 folder
simulation. 

Postaci is multilanguage. It currently supports Turkish, English, German, French, Portuguese, 
Spanish, Polish, Norwegian, Dutch, Italian . If you want to see Postaci in your language just 
translate one of the files in lang directory and send it to me. 

Postaci includes multidomain(virtual) support. Domains are stored in a DB
table and all users must be linked to a domain. It can be done at
tblDomains and tblUsers tables at the database. If you have a single
domain on your server you won' t need to do this. There must be at least
one domain at the database and its index should be 1. This is the default
domain for any user. You can change your default domain at the tblDomain.sql
file at the queries folder.

This software is distrubuted with GNU GPL license and you can find a copy with the package.

This software is tested with real life positions but there should be at
least a few bugs. You can report any kind of bug to
"Umut Gökbayrak" <umut@trlinux.com>

This software was developed on a Red Hat Linux system and tested with many
conditions using PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.

It uses IMAP c-client libraries which you can find a copy at
ftp://ftp.onar.com.tr/pub/linux/console/php/c-client.tar.gz

Any Pentium machine should be enough for the software to work but a
P III or AMD K7 system with 128 M is recommended.

-------------------------------------------------------

2. Step by step Installation.
Below, is an example for PHP + IMAP + Apache installation. If you want to use another database
that Postaci supports, refer to your preferred databases' s documentation. If you need more assistance
on installing PHP + Apache + c-client please see section 3.

* Set up MySQL. (http://www.mysql.org)

* Setup c-client to server.
(ftp://ftp.onar.com.tr/pub/linux/console/php/c-client.tar.gz)

* Setup PHP and apache. (PHP3 WON' T WORK...!!!) (http://www.php.net)

* make sure the following lines exist in your httpd.conf file and uncommented.

* IMPORTANT!!!!
* Pay attention to the .inc extension!!!! It is a must for a secure environment.
* IMPORTANT!!!!

  AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .php3 .phtml .inc
  AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

* Create a database for postaci. This can be done with the command "mysqladmin create postaci"

* make sure the database name is the same at includes/global.inc file.

* Create a temp folder for sending attachments. All the permissions should be the user nobody' This is the user which apacheruns as. use the following commands...

	mkdir /tmp/postaci/
  mkdir /tmp/postaci/send/
  mkdir /tmp/postaci/store
	chown nobody.nobody -R /tmp/postaci
	chmod 770 -R /tmp/postaci

* make sure the directory is correctly specified at the includes/global.inc file.

* run the following command and create the necessary tables in the DB.

	cd queries
	mysql postaci < postaci-mysql-1.1.sql

* insert the domains you like to the tblDomains.sql file in queries folder. The syntax is as follows.

	INSERT INTO tblDomains VALUES (1,'trlinux.com');
	INSERT INTO tblDomains VALUES (2,'test.com');

* Insert the data for Domains to the DB with the following command.

	mysql postaci < tblDomains.sql

* Create a Database USER.

	$ mysql postaci
	mysql > grant usage on postaci.* to dbuser@localhost;
	mysql > grant select,insert,delete,update on postaci.* to dbuser@localhost;
	mysql > exit;
	$ mysqladmin -u dbuser password "new password"

* make sure the password is the same as "new password" in the includes/global.inc file.

* put your postaci files to a reachable directory and point your browser to that URL.

* thats all........

1. Database Independency
   Postaci 1.1.0 uses an interface class to handle database connections. It is fast and efficient.
   As this version it currently supports :

   MySQL
   PostgreSQL
   Sybase
   mSQL
   Microsoft SQL

   Interbase, Oracle, Informix support is in the TO DO List.

2. Protocol Independency
   Postaci 1.1.0 can handle both POP3 and IMAP standarts. If IMAP support is selected during setup
   it will use real IMAP folders that is stored at the users' home directory. If POP3 support is
   enabled, because POP3 doesn' t provide folder support it will simulate it by using database tables
   and store the e-mail in the database, whatever engine it is.

3. A frameless, completely new user interface
   Postaci 1.1.0 is very much different than Postaci 1.0.x series in the users' view. The user interface
   was written from strach.

4. Object Oriented Programming
   Postaci Webmail' s source code was written from strach to support Object Oriented Programming skills.

5. Session Support
   Postaci 1.1.0 is programmed to work only with PHP4 because it uses built-in session support from PHP4.
   IT WILL NOT WORK WITH PHP3!!!.

6. Platform Independeny
   Postaci 1.1.0 doesn' t use any native code. So it should work on any architecture and any operating
   system which PHP supports.

7. Tens of improvements and bug fixes.
   Postaci 1.1.0 is a work derived from the feedbacks. Nearly all most wanted feautures are included in this
   release.

8. Remote SMTP and POP3/IMAP support
   Postaci 1.1.0 can fetch and send mail from/through remote servers. You don' t need to set up e-mail, http,
   pop3/imap server on the same machine any more....

9. Better support for virtual domains.
   As from version 1.0.0, Postaci can handle with as many domain names as you want.

10. Better localization support
   Version 1.1.0 uses plain text files for localization. It is simpler to translate it to any other language.

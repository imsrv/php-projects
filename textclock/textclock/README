TextClock is a Perl CGI script which is meant to be run from Server Side 
Includes.  For more information on Server Side Includes, check out the 
FAQ at the URL mentioned above.  When this script is implemented, it can 
be used to show browsers several variations of the current time and/or 
date.

There are two files included with this script:
        1) README 	- This file; includes detailed installation 
			  instructions.
        2) textclock.pl - The Perl script which generates the headers 
			  and sends the current time and/or date to 
			  your user.

Should you encounter any problems running this script, such as Method Not
Implemented, try changing the name of the program to nph-textclock.cgi, 
as some servers require the use of .cgi extensions.  Otherwise, this 
script must be placed in your cgi-bin.  There are several variables which
must be edited in the textclock.pl script.

TEXTCLOCK.PL -

    There are up to nine variables in the textclock.pl script, however
    if you wish to receive the default display, you need not edit any
    of them.  You can mix and match all of these options and see which
    kind of clock you like the best.  You can get the clock to display
    only the day of the week, only the date, only the time, everything
    or make up your own combination!

	$Display_Week_Day = '1';
		If this option is set to '1', the day of the week will be 
		displayed; Possible Values: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
		Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Setting this option
		to '0' will suppress the printing of the Day of the Week.

	$Display_Month = '1';
		If this option is set to '1', the month will be printed.
		Possible values include: January, February, March, April, May,
		June, July, August, September, October, November and December.
		If this option is set to '0', the month will not be displayed.

	$Display_Month_Day = '1';
		If this option is set to '1', the day of the month is
		displayed, containing a value from 01 - 31.  Setting this to
		'0' will hide the Day of the Month.

	$Display_Year = '1';
		If this option is set to '1', the four digit year is 
		displayed, and it can be hidden by setting this to '0'.

	$Display_Time = '1';
		If this option is set to '1', a twenty four hour clock is
		displayed.  Otherwise, if it is set to '0', it is supressed.

	$Display_Time_Zone = '1';
		Setting this to '1' allows users to your site to know what
		time zone the date is being displayed from.  If it is set
		to '1', the script will determine if it is Daylight Savings
		or not.  If so, it uses $Daylight_Time_Zone as the Time Zone
		to display.  Otherwise it uses $Standard_Time_Zone.

	$Standard_Time_Zone = 'EST';
	$Daylight_Time_Zone = 'EDT';
		These are the names of your Time Zones.  The ones shown above
		represent Eastern Coast Time Zones.  Other ones in the US
		include Central Time (CST/CDT), Mountain Time (MST/MDT) and
		Pacific Coast Time (PST/PDT).

	$Display_Link = '1';
		Wanna be generous and offer visitors a link to my site where
		they can download this script?  If so, leave this set to '1'
		and the displayed date will be linked to my web site.
		Otehrwise, set it to '0'.

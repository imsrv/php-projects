The detection stages can be set to <i>Active</i> or <i>Stopped</i> in any combination you wish. A page request will pass through each stage that is set to <i>Active</i> to be checked against the criteria for that stage that may identify the request as being from a spider. <br><br>For example, if <b>IP STAGE 1</b> is set to <i>Active</i>, since this stage checks only for an IP Address match, the page request will be checked against the first IP Address in the ICS database, if there is no match it will be passed on to the next <i>Active</i> stage. This process continues until one of the <i>Active</i> stages identifies the request. If all stages <b>AND</b> all /IP/=Directory=/UserAgent/& statements are exhausted without a match, then the human page is served.<br><br>
<ul>
<li><u>There are two exceptions to this:</u>
<ul>
<li>If <b>Browser MultiStage Detection</b> has been set to <i>Active</i> then a five stage check is done on the page request, if the footprint is that of a human visitor browser, then all further active stages are bypassed and the human page is served. This check goes far beyond just checking if it is a Mozilla agent, it can detect human visitors 99% of the time. The other 1% will pass through the active spider detection stages before being eliminated as a spider because it is a human visitor, and will be served the human page. Spiders will pass through <b>Browser MultiStage Detection</b> to the following active stages for detection, even if the spiders are using Mozilla as a user agent trying to emulate a regular visitor.<br><br>
<li>The other exception is <b>Generic Spider Detection</b>. If this stage is set to <i>Active</i> then the page request is checked for a generic spider match after all other active stages have been exhausted. This ensures that only spiders not matched in any prior stages are detected by this stage.<br><br>

Set this to <i>Active</i> to detect regular visitors through a mutlistage check. When the criteria is satisfied a human page is served otherwise it is passed on to the next active stage.<br><br> This stage can reliably detect human visitors and proxy servers which tend to carry a full visitor footprint, and since the spider detection process is avoided on a majority of hits by using this stage, it makes for a very responsive system.

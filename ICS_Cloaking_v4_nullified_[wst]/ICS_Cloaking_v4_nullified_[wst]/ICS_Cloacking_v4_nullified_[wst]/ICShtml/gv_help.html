Although information such as the the path to your root directory, and the path to sendmail is best obtained from your ISP there is an included script with ICS that can often determine most of this information for you. Navigate to http://www.yourdomain.com/ICScgi/GetSiteInfo.cgi to have ICS retrieve this information for you.

You may have to ask your ISP for the path to sendmail on your web hosting server. The path shown by default is used on many servers, but this is by no means standard. In order for the e-mail notification features to work you must specify the correct path.

This is the path to the directory that will hold all ICS CGI scripts. 
Let's assume you must run all cgi programs from a cgi-bin directory and you chose to name the directory to hold ICS cgi's 'ICScgi', you would specify the path to the cgi directory as <font color=green>cgi-bin/ICScgi</font> If you can run cgi's anywhere and created 'ICScgi' in your root then simply enter <font color=green>ICScgi</font> Incorrect would be <font color=green>/cgi-bin/ICScgi/</font> or <font color=green>cgi-bin/ICScgi/</font> or <font color=green>/cgi-bin/ICScgi</font>

This is the directory that will hold all subdirectories of search engines and the human visitor directory. These will subsequently hold replicas of pages to be served according to visitor. You may specify any directory name you wish. It is a good idea not to use the default of 'SEdirect' because if people know your directory structure then they can see your cloaked pages.

This is the directory that will hold the IP Address list, and the logs for spider visits and human visits, as well as the spider footprint log. The default name is IPDirect.

IF YOU ARE NOT UPGRADING FROM AN EARLIER VERSION OF ICS YOU MAY IGNORE THE HTML VARIABLE AND THE URI VARIABLE.
This variable is included for backward compatability to older ICS versions. It is only used by sites that are determining the page name by URI. If you are new to ICS simply leave this set to <b>html</b>, and leave the URI variable to <i>no</i>. If you are upgrading from a previous version of ICS and are using SSI statements which do <b>not</b> have a "?" question mark in them, and do not have the pagename in the SSI statement, then you are using the URI version. You should then set the <i>Using URI</i> Variable to <i>yes</i> and set the html page extension variable to what is used at your site for pages served by ICS.

i.e. if the page name on the SSI statement (or URI if enabled) contains a directory as well as a pagename then ICS will look for that directory and page name within the HumanVisitor and each of the search engine directories.

<u>Set <b>Enable Directory Mirroring</b> to <i>No</i></u><br> to have ICS look for all cloaked pages in the root of the HumanVisitor and the search engine directories.

If you are unsure of whether or not you should enable directory mirroring then begin by setting <b>Enable Directory Mirroring</b> to <i>No</i> since it is initially easier, you can always decide to change it to <i>Yes</i> and mirror your directory and subdirectory structure later.

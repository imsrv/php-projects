		Moe Music 0.3.0 Install Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Make sure you have php3 installed with support for mySQL compiled in

	- Under RedHat make sure you have all of the mySQL devel rpms
	  installed or php3 wont compile.
	- I reccomend compiling php3 from source rather than using the
	  rpm's for mySQL extensionm becasue i could never get them to 
	  work.

2. Make sure you have mySQL installed
	
	- Create a database for Moe Music to use
	  Just log in to mySQLK as root and type
	
	  mysql> create database moemusic;

	- Then create the following tables

	create table artist(a_name varchar(30) not null,
	a_id smallint unsigned not null primary key auto_incrememt);

	create table queue(q_number bigint primary key not null auto_increment,
	s_id int unsigned not null);

	create table song(s_name varchar(30) not null,
	s_id int unsigned not null primary key auto_increment,
	a_id smallint unsigned not null,
	file_name varchar(60) not null);

	- just type each line as written into mySQL to do this

3. Make sure the Moe Music php files are in a section of your web server that
   be seen by the world. I just created a virtual server and aliased an ip to
   it. To do this see the apache documentation

4. Move the moe_config file out of the web server tree. Your users home direcotry
   is a good choice here. Then as root do the follwing
	
	- chown [your username here].nobody moe_config 
	  chmod 640 moe_config
	  This will make sure the group nobody will be able to read the config file
	  but nobody else. If apache runs as a user apart from nobody on your machine
          then make sure to replace nobody with that user.
        
        - Edit the moe_conf that is in the web tree to point to the absolute path of
          the moe_config file. Warning the admin password security wise is
	  a joke at best

5. At this point you should be able to open your web browser and load moe
music. 
   You will need to enter each of the mp3's on the machine into the databse by hand 
   at this stage.

6. Send an email to jwrennie@bigpond.com telling me that you have it up and running
   so i can have a warm fuzzy glow. Or send an email abusing me for the shoddy
   nature of the documentation etc ...

7. Enjoy

			Moe Music Ver 0.1.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moe Music Ver 0.1.2 is a web front end to mpg123 along with a mySQL database
for the backend book keeping. I wrote the program to assist with LAN
Parties, and to end 7 different people all playing mp3's on there
computers at once. It was intended to provide a central place for music to
be played from and includes support for queueing songs etc,

As of this release of Moe Music, it is possible to add artists to the
catalog and index songs on the server by the artists. It is also possible
to play the songs. 

It is quite functional currently and everything you can see works except
for the indexing from an uploaded directory that i hoipe to have running
by the next release.

email me jwrennie@bigpond.com if you have any queries or suggestions about
the program or would like to help with its development.

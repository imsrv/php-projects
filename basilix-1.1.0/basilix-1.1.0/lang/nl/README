lang_nl.tar.gz
------- v0.1 -

This file contains a languagepack for Basilix 1.0.3b.
The language included is Dutch (Nederlands)

To install this package, unzip this .tar.gz file to
/usr/local/basilix/lang

This way there will be a new directory called
/usr/local/basilix/lang/nl
Verify this! 

In /usr/local/basilix/conf/lang.conf you add:

$bsx_lang[$i]["long"]           = "Nederlands";
$bsx_lang[$i]["short"]          = "nl";
$bsx_lang[$i++]["charset"]      = "iso8859-1";

This way Basilix knows that the Dutch language is available.
If you want the default language to be set to Dutch, at the bottom
of the same file change

$BSX_DEFAULT_LANG               = 1; 

to whatever the index is of the Dutch language. Basilix starts counting
from 0, so if Dutch is the 3rd option in you list, you should set
$BSX_DEFAULT_LANG to be 2.

Now login to your mailaccount and set your language too Dutch.

Klaar! (Done!)

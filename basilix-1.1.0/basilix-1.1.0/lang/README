To create your language's messages:
o copy the directory of english version to your language.
  (italian is given as an example)

	$ cp -R en it

o enter the directory "it"
	
	$ cd it

o edit the files.
o add the new language to the /usr/local/basilix/conf/lang.conf:

	$bsx_lang[$i]["long"]           = "Italiano";
	$bsx_lang[$i]["short"]          = "it";
	$bsx_lang[$i++]["charset"]      = "iso8859-1";	// its charset

-
That's all, now your language is active

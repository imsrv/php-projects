After you are finished with the basilix installation, you should
create your MySQL database. (Since the postgresql class hasn't been
written yet, we cannot use it at the moment)

Connect to the MySQL server, where dbuser is the username, and dbpass
is the password needed to connect to the MySQL server.

$ mysql -u dbuser -p dbpass
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 5525 to server version: 3.23.33

Type 'help' for help.

mysql>

After that type enter the following commands at the mysql> prompt.
(change "bsxpass" at the third line with your desired password)

mysql> CREATE DATABASE BASILIX;
mysql> GRANT ALL ON BASILIX.* TO bsxuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'bsxpass';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> QUIT;

The first line creates a database named "BASILIX". The second line 
give some privileges to "bsxuser@localhost" with password
"bsxpass". Don't forget to change the password here.

Now your database is ready, enter the following line to create the 
tables needed by BasiliX (change bsxpass with the password you choosed
above and change /usr/local/basilix if the installation directory is
different).

$ mysql -u bsxuser -p bsxpass < /usr/local/basilix/db/mysql/basilix.sql

(If the above command gives permission error, try with the mysql user
or the root user)

Edit the file /usr/local/basilix/dbset/mysql-set.inc, and 
change the username, password and hostname variables with respect to
the above settings.

Finally, in the same file, you will see two functions, pwencrypt()
and pwdecrypt() which are used to encrypt/decrypt the passwords
stored temporarily in the database. Simply, they use the base64
encoding, but you may want to use another two-way encoding
algorithm rather than base64. We encrypt the passwords while
staying in the database to prevent them to be seen plaintext when
a "select" query is processed at the mysql prompt or any other place.

1.0.5b -> 1.1.0
	Step 1:
	After you backuped your configuration files 
	(default directory is /usr/local/basilix/conf) and
	the HTML template files if you made changes (the 
	default dir is 	/usr/local/basilix/htx), extract
	the archive in /usr/local/basilix. Restore the
	files you backuped.

	Step 2:
	You need to alter the SESSION and SETTINGS tables.
	After you login to mysql (as root) apply the following 
	commands (you can copy and paste):

	ALTER TABLE SESSION ADD LASTFOLDERS TEXT;
	ALTER TABLE SESSION MODIFY USERNAME VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL;
	ALTER TABLE SESSION MODIFY PASSWORD VARCHAR(96) NOT NULL;
	ALTER TABLE SETTINGS ADD IFEXPAND CHAR(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0';
	ALTER TABLE SETTINGS ADD PREVNEXT CHAR(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0';
	ALTER TABLE SETTINGS ADD REPLYTO VARCHAR(96);

	Also, you'll see a new table in /usr/local/basilix/db/mysql/basilix.sql
	named as SENDMSGS. Copy and paste this CREATE command.

1.0.3b -> 1.0.5b

	Backup your configuration files (in directory
	/usr/local/basilix/conf). Remove the whole basilix
	directory which is default /usr/local/basilix
	(if you changed some other files, backup them also).
	Install the version 1.0.4b and restore the backuped files.

1.0.2b -> 1.0.3b

	Backup your configuration files (in directory
	/usr/local/basilix/conf). Remove the whole basilix
	directory which is default /usr/local/basilix
	(if you changed some other files, backup them also).
	Install the version 1.0.3b. Restore the backuped files
	and finally set the dbuser, dbpass, and dbhost settings in
	/usr/local/basilix/dbset/mysql-set.inc.

0.9.7 -> 1.0.3b:
      -> 1.0.4b:

	After successfully installation of 1.0.3b, change the
	old_dbuser, old_dbpass and old_dbhost in 
	/usr/local/basilix/lib/abook.inc with the ones of 0.9.7. 
	In the Addressbook window you will see a "Import old entries"
	link which imports the old entries to the new one and then
	delete the olds. I recommend you to backup the addressbook 
	table of the old database before running the new version.
	You can process the backup job with:

	mysql_dump -u dbuser -p basilix AddressBook > addr_dump.txt
	where "dbuser" is the user of the old database, "basilix"
	is the database name and "AddressBook" is the table name.


0.9.7 -> 1.0.2b:
	
	You can use 1.0.2b, but it's not backward compatible (you have
	to erase the old database). I recommend you to download v1.0.3b
	and read the above section.

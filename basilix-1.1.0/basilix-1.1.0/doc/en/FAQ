Frequently Asked Questions and the Answers:
===========================================

First, questions:
-----------------
Q1) I just set up the BasiliX but I got a blank page!?

Q2) My PHP is IMAP and MySQL enabled, but still blank page!?

Q3) I use Netscape/Explorer and BasiliX redirects me to the
    download page of Netscape/Explorer??

Q4) I got "Fatal error: Maximum execution of XX seconds exceeded"
    error?


Now, the answers:
-----------------
A1) Check your PHP if it's IMAP enabled or not. In file 
    lib/imap.class, in function open(), you'll see imap_open()
    is called. There, in front of the imap_open(), is a @ char
    which prevents showing warning messages of invalid logins.
    Remove the @ char, and try again. If you get a Fatal Error
    (imap_open() no such function), your PHP is not IMAP enabled.

A2) Check the include_path variable set in php3.ini (or php.ini)
    usually resides in /usr/local/lib. Try adding the basilix directory
    which is "/usr/local/basilix" to the value of include_path.

A3) You must upgrade your browser.
    for Netscape > 4.0
    for IE Explorer > 4.0

A4) Try uncommenting the line set_time_limit(0) in file lib/util.inc.

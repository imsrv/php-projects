History of E*Reminders 
----------------------
Late one night Jim Suto (jim@amazinglinux.com) was awake and started
thinking that since e-mail is becoming so widely used these days, it would be
nice to have a way that a system can provide notifications and reminders via
this medium. Especially if you have a cellphone equipped with email capability
this could be very handy. 

He told Ben Suto of the idea and Ben thought it would make sense to code the
interface in PHP. Ben put together the script a couple of days later and Ben and
Jim tested it and were really happy with the result. Jim later also refined the
code himself somewhat and gave Ben the ok to make it GPL and release it. 

E*Reminders was reviewed once in the Linux Journal magazine. 

Ben passed away unfortunately and suddenly late in 2000, and will be missed
from the project. He provided a terrific code foundation which runs
E*Reminders today.

  for the report.  Improved uses text in help and config windows.

		(courtesy, Glen Stewart)
		
- Accounts older than 90 days with no pending reminders are purged
  automatically as part of mail.php3 functions.  This took care of 
  the one thing left in the old TODO list.
- More help and descriptions on the main E*Reminder page.
- Date and time default to server time when first page is brought up.
  This means the old index.html has become index.php3
- New accounts are told to get their password from email and use their
  BACK button to set their first reminder.
- References to config.in have been changed to config.php3 in INSTALL,
  which was also slightly simplified.

April 24, 1999: E*Reminders-0.86 Release

- Fixed security hole where database password is readable from the
  Internet.  For instructions on how to implement this fix without
  replacing 0.85 entirely, read the file UPGRADE that should have
  come with your distribution of this software.

April 23, 1999: E*Reminders-0.85 Released

- Small modifications of GUI, increased level of consistency.
- New mechanism for creating accounts to keep system from being misused.
- Users can now block any E-mail from going to their accounts.
- Cleaned up some of the messages, and made the software more modular.
- Small modifications of INSTALL documentation.


April 17, 1999: E*Reminders-0.8 Released to Original Authors 
		(courtesy, Glen Stewart)

- HTML GUI given a consistent, polished look
- Timezone support added to event entry page & subsequent output
- Extensive info supplied to event recipient to identify possible abusers
  and to stop recurring events.  IP #'s and dates are tracked.
- Recurring & notify value bugs fixed from previous release
- Added "Event" name (Subject, actually) instead of truncating the message
  body for a partial subject.
- Added mouse-tip help "?" icons to the entry page to get users rolling.
- Switched system to .php3 files - mail.php3 now executed via wget or lynx cron
- Shipping releases will not allow recurring events of minute and hour duration
  due to possible abuses and server loading.  If you need this, find the
  commented-out section of index.html
- Revised date displays throughout for consistency.
- Added support for monthly and yearly recurring events.
- Added options in config.in for dbtimezone and dbtzcorrect.
  Read about these in the README file (which is also much improved).
- Enjoy!


February 5, 1999: EReminders-0.02 Released

- The database name has been changed from calendar to reminders
- Some general tweaks  
- Some of the prompts have been made a little friendlier.
- Updates to install documentation.
- Fixed a bug where if a user created a reminder that was set in the past,
  and he sets it recurring, it would send them a message every time
  mail.php3 is run.  Now, it will automatically make it recur at the next
  time in the future, and will honor the recurrence settings.

November 30, 1998: Initial Release

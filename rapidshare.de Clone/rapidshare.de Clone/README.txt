Mini File Host is a free file hosting service script. It is modeled 
after the many popular free file hosts like rapidshare 
and megaupload. It is easy to set up and use and it 
doesn't even require a MySQL database!

Notice: Before you create your own file host site, 
make sure that you have the resources to! If you don't
have a lot of space and bandwidth, you shouldn't run 
a file hosting service. If people upload files to your site and 
your site is taken down, they won't be very happy. 
Also make sure that it isn't against your host's 
terms of service to run a file host.


How to install:

 - edit config.php and set your own settings

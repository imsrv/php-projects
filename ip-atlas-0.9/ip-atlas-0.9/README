IP-Atlas version 0.9
-=----=-

Description
-----------
This script uses NetGeo to plot a host on the globe.

Requirements
------------
PHP 4 and GD (Optional).

The GD library is available at http://www.boutell.com/gd/ and PHP is at
http://www.php.net/

Installation
------------
Put these files somewhere on your webserver, and point your browser to plot.php

Note: You can symlink "ln -s plot.php index.php" if you need to. If you 
have any problems running it, send an email to ivan@xpenguin.com

Configuration
-------------
All options can be edited in plotconf.inc. 

If you want to integrate IP-Atlas into your website, open up plot.php and
ip-atlas_prefs.php and edit the parts where it starts writing the html
(find for "<html>") and where it ends (</html>). You should replace theses
with your site template headers/footers.

You can create a new language file for IP-Atlas, with three steps:

1. copy language.en.inc to language.<country code>.inc
2. edit the newly copied language file
3. open up plotconf.inc and change the $language variable.

If you create a new language file, please email it to ivan@xpenguin.com so 
it can be included in the next version.

Bugs
----
1. The famous windows bug

If nothing appears when running the script on windows, open up plot.inc and
find the section that says:

function istheregd() {
        if (@ImageTypes() & IMG_PNG) {
                 return TRUE;
        } else {
                 return FALSE;
        }
}

and replace it with:

function istheregd() {
        return FALSE;
}

I. Summary

	phpInstantGallery generates an html gallery from images on its server.  The script scans 
	the directory you point it to (via a query string), and it stores the list of images it 
	retreives in an array that is POSTED from page to page as the user moves through the gallery.  
	This method of file-list-passing makes phpInstantGallery significantly more efficient than
	gallery tools that scan directories for the data they need to construct galleries.
	
	phpInstantGallery generates two types of html pages: thumbnail and image pages.  From a 
	thumbnail page, the user can click on any thumb to go to that thumb's corresponding image page.  
	The image page contains the thumb's larger counterpart, as well as a scroll bar that allows the 
	user to either scroll between the previous/next image pages, or click back to the thumb page.
	
	phpInstantGallery allows for the use of multiple templates.  You can maintain one template, or 
	you can define multiple templates, and select which template to use in the query string.


II. Requirements

	* PHP 4.0.0 or later

	* Image Requirements (IMPORTANT):  All thumbnail images must have the same file name as their 
	  larger counterpart, but with a common flag just before the file extension.  You can define 
	  what you want the flag to be in the config file - config.php.  For example, if you define 
	  your flag to be "-00" then the thumbnail for "image.jpg" would need to be named "image-00.jpg".
	  Also, none of the larger images can contain the flag before the extention.  The script does 
	  not work when the flag is "-01", and there is an image pair named "image-01.jpg" and 
	  "image-01-01.jpg".
	  
	  
III. Installation

	1. Download pig-x.y.tar.gz (or pig-x.y.tar for Windows users) from
	   http://www.ikemcg.com/scripts/pig/index.html
	
	2. Untar/unzip phpInstantGallery into the directory you want.  Default is phpInstantGallery.
	
	3. Change phpInstantGallery directory to desired name.  Gallery URLs will always be the http 
	   call to the script's index.php file plus a query string.
	   
	4. Create a folder on your server where you will store gallery images.  I recommend that you 
	   create this folder outside the directory the scripts are in, and that you dedicate this 
	   folder to gallery images.  The path to this folder will be the string value you will assign 
	   to the $galleryroot variable in config.php.
	   
	5. Make changes to config.php.  The file is fairly well documented.
	
	6. Prepare images according to the image requirements described in the requirements section 
	   above.  Make a new directory in the root gallery folder you created in step four, and upload 
	   your images to that directory.  (Note: to help organize your galleries, you can create 
	   subfolders in the root gallery folder, and then put galleries, i.e. folders with gallery 
	   images, in those subfolders.)
	   
	7. Go to index.php in a web browser, and log in to the admin page to get the URLs for whatever
	   galleries you uploaded.
	   
	   
IV. Upgrading From Version 1.0

	1. To upgrade from version 1.0, rename the folder that contains your current phpInstant gallery 
	   scripts, then follow the instuctions above.  Edit the new config.php file, do not overwrite 
	   the new file with the old one, as variable names have changed.  When you finish, copy your 
	   old templates to the new template folder, and make the below changes to each template.
	   
	2. In the header.php file, change the imgList() javascript function to:
	   
	   function imgList() {
			var imglist = new Array('<? echo implode("', '", $imglist); ?>');

			for (var i=0; i < imglist.length; i++) {
				document.writeln ("<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"imglist[]\" value=\"" + imglist[i] + "\">\n"); 
			}
		}
		
	3. In the image_page.php file change the function that reads getScrollBar($imgNo, $imgCnt, $gallery, $tmplt);
	   to getScrollBar($imgno);
	   
	4. That should do it.
	   
	   
V. Template Customization

	* Definition:
	
	A phpInstantGallery template is a folder, under the template directory, that contains three
	files: header.php, image_page.php, and thumb_page.php.  image_page.php is the template for the 
	page that shows the large image and scroll bar, thumb_page.php is the template for the thumbnail 
	page, and header.php is included at the top of each page.  Each of the  three files contains 
	its own documentation.

	* Adding New Templates:
	
	You can add a new template without changing or deleting the default template.  If you define 
	multiple templates you can select among them by specifying the template name in the query string. 
	To add a template, copy the default folder and it's contents to the same location, but with a 
	different name.  The name you give the new folder is the name of the new template.  Edit 
	the template files however you like.  You can then use the admin page to get the URLs to 
	all your galleries dressed in the new template.

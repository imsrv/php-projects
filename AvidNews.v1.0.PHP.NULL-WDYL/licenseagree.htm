   AVIDNEWS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT</P>
  <P>
   This Software License Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) is made and 
   effective this July 22, 2003 by and between AvidNewMedia 
   (&quot;Developer&quot;) and you (&quot;Licensee&quot;).</P>
  <P>
   Developer has developed and licenses to users its software program 
   marketed under the name AvidNews v1.0 (the &quot;Software&quot;).</P>
  <P>
   Licensee desires to utilize a copy of the Software.<BR>
   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises set forth 
   herein, Developer and Licensee agree as follows:</P>
  <P>
   1. License.<BR>
   Developer hereby grants to Licensee a perpetual, non-exclusive, 
   limited license to use the Software in the United States of America 
   as set forth in this Agreement.</P>
  <P>
   2. Restrictions.<BR>
   Licensee shall not modify, copy, duplicate, reproduce, license or 
   sublicense the Software, or transfer or convey the Software or any 
   right in the Software to anyone else without the prior written 
   consent of Developer; provided that Licensee may make one copy of the 
   Software for backup or archival purposes. License shall have no right 
   to copy, reproduce, sell, or otherwise profit from the use of 
   AvidNews. AvidNews is intended for the end-user's use only.</P>
  <P>
   End user or purchaser of this software may in no way reverse 
   engineer, copy, or other duplicate AvidNews, or any AvidNews product.</P>
  <P>
   3. Fee.<BR>
   In consideration for the grant of the license and the use of the 
   Software, Licensee agrees to pay Developer the sum of Fifty dollars ($50.00).</P>
  <P>
   4. Warranty of Title.<BR>
   Developer hereby represents and warrants to Licensee that Developer 
   is the owner of the Software or otherwise has the right to grant to 
   Licensee the rights set forth in this Agreement. In the event of any 
   breach or threatened breach of the foregoing representation and 
   warranty, Licensee's sole remedy shall be to require Developer or to 
   either: i) procure, at Developer's expense, the right to use the 
   Software, ii) replace the Software or any part thereof that is in 
   breach and replace it with Software of comparable functionality that 
   does not cause any breach, or iii) refund to Licensee the full amount 
   of the license fee upon the return of the Software and all copies 
   thereof to Developer.</P>
  <P>
   5. Warranty of Functionality.<BR>
   A. For a period of six (6) months following delivery of the Software 
   to Licensee (the &quot;Warranty Period&quot;), Developer warrants 
   that the Software shall perform in all material respects according to 
   the Developer's specifications concerning the Software when used with 
   the appropriate computer equipment. In the event of any breach or 
   alleged breach of this warranty, Licensee shall promptly notify 
   Developer and return the Software to Developer at Licensee's expense. 
   Licensee's sole remedy shall be that Developer shall correct the 
   Software so that it operates according to the warranty. This warranty 
   shall not apply to the Software if modified by anyone or if used 
   improperly or on an operating environment not approved by Developer.</P>
  <P>
   B. In the event of any defect in the media upon which the Software is 
   provided arising within forty-five (45)days of the date of delivery 
   of the Software, upon return to Developer of the Software upon the 
   original media, Developer shall provide Licensee a new copy of the Software.</P>
  <P>
   6. Software Maintenance.<BR>
   A. Standard maintenance. During the Warranty Period, Developer shall 
   provide to Licensee any new, corrected or enhanced version of the 
   Software as created by Developer. Such enhancement shall include all 
   modifications to the Software which increase the speed, efficiency or 
   ease of use of the Software, or add additional capabilities or 
   functionality to the Software, but shall not include any 
   substantially new or rewritten version of the Software.</P>
  <P>
   B. Optional maintenance. After expiration of the Warranty Period, 
   Licensee may continue to receive maintenance support for successive 
   twelve (12) month periods. The charge for such optional maintenance 
   support shall be Developer's regular list price for maintenance and 
   support for the Software as published from time to time by Developer. 
   Licensor shall notify Developer in writing if it desires to receive 
   optional maintenance. If Licensee fails to take optional maintenance 
   and later elects to receive it, Developer reserves the right to 
   charge Licensee its maintenance fees for the period of the lapse in 
   maintenance. Developer may elect to discontinue maintenance at any 
   time upon notice to Licensee, and refund of any then unearned 
   maintenance fees.</P>
  <P>
   7. Payment.<BR>
   Payment of the license fee shall be made upon delivery of the 
   Software. Payment of any other amount owed by Licensee to Developer 
   pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid within thirty (30) days 
   following invoice from Developer. In the event any overdue amount 
   owed by Licensee is not paid following ten (10) days written notice 
   from Developer, then in addition to any other amount due, Developer 
   may impose and Licensee shall pay a late payment charge at the rate 
   of one percent (1%) per month on any overdue amount.</P>
  <P>
   8. Taxes.<BR>
   In addition to all other amounts due hereunder, Licensee shall also 
   pay to Developer, or reimburse Developer as appropriate, all amounts 
   due for property tax on the Software and for sales, use, excise taxes 
   or other taxes which are measured directly by payments made by 
   Licensee to Developer. In no event shall Licensee be obligated to pay 
   any tax paid on the income of Developer or paid for Developer's 
   privilege of doing business.</P>
  <P>
   9. Warranty Disclaimer.<BR>
   DEVELOPER'S WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE EXCLUSIVE AND 
   ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING 
   BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</P>
  <P>
   10. Limitation of Liability.<BR>
   Developer shall not be responsible for, and shall not pay, any amount 
   of incidental, consequential or other indirect damages, whether based 
   on lost revenue or otherwise, regardless of whether Developer was 
   advised of the possibility of such losses in advance. In no event 
   shall Developer's liability hereunder exceed the amount of license 
   fees paid by Licensee, regardless of whether Licensee's claim is 
   based on contract, tort, strict liability, product liability or otherwise.</P>
  <P>

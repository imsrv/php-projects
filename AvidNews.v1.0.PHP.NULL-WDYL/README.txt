THANK YOU FOR PURCHASING AVIDNEWS v1.0!

TO INSTALL, PLEASE READ BELOW:

1. Login into your control panel, and create a database.
Then create a username and password for your database, and associate
them with your database.  If you're not sure how to do this, please
ask your host.

2. Once you have finished step 1, you will need to create a directory on your web space.  You may name it anything you want.  Most people
name it "news".

3. Upload all of the files that are in the zip file to the directory
you created in step 2.  Make sure to change the CHMOD permission of the file "config.php" and the folder "images"  to 777 or 0777

4. Run install.php via a web browser, by going to the directory that
you created in step 2. (i.e. http://yourdomain.com/news/)

5. You will be presented with the AvidNews Software License Agreement.

6. If you agreed to the AvidNews Software License Agreement, you will
be presented with a database setup form.  Fill out the form, following all of the instructions.

Once AvidNews finishes installation, you will be presented with a login.

Your initial login information will be:
Username: admin
Password: test

We suggest changing this password as soon as you login, for your safety.

Once you are able to login successfully, remove the files:
install.php, newinstall.php, and index.html.  Otherwise, it is possible for someone to overwrite all of your data, by doing a fresh install.

You will be able to access your admin and writer panel at:

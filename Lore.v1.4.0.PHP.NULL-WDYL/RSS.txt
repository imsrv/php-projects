As of version 1.3.0, Lore supports RSS syndication of articles. This means that you 
can use any RSS feed reader to get a listing of latest articles, highest rated articles, 
most popular articles, or a list of articles in any category of your knowledge base.

Lore supports the following versions of RSS:

* 0.91 
* 0.92 
* 1.0 
* 2.0

Using the included RSS script:

In the base directory of your Lore installation, you will find a script named rss.php. 
When this script is called via HTTP, it will return RSS based on your input. The script 
takes three parameters in the query:

* action - defines what content should be sent: Options are: 
    -  articles - retrieve articles from a given category 
    -  latest_articles - retrieve a list of the latest articles 
    -  highest_rated_articles - retrieve a list of the highest rated articles 
    -  most_viewed_articles - retrieve a list of the most viewed articles
* category_id - the id of the category to retrieve articles from (only used 
                when action = articles) 
* version - the RSS version to return results in. Options are: 
    - 0.91 
    - 0.92 
    - 1.0 
    - 2.0


The rss.php script can be accessed like any other URL:
http://example.com/kb/rss.phpaction=articles&category_id=1&version=0.91

The above example will return a list of the articles in category number 1 
(usually the root category), in RSS version 0.91 format.

Examples:

Return list of latest articles in RSS version 2.0
http://example.com/kb/rss.php?action=latest_articles&version=2.0

Return list of highest rated articles in RSS version 1.0
http://example.com/kb/rss.php?action=highest_rated_articles&version=1.0

Return list of articles in category 10 in RSS version 0.91
http://example.com/kb/rss.php?action=articles&category_id=10version=0.91


When an RSS feed reader asks for the location of the RSS feed, you would enter 
a URL similar to the examples above (but with your real domain name and path). 
Many popular open source portal systems (such as PHP-Nuke, PostNuke, etc.) support 
RSS feeds.

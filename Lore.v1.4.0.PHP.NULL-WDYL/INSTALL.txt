This file contains instructions for doing a FRESH installation of
Lore (starting with a clean database). Do not follow these instructions
if you are upgrading.

Installation Instructions:

1. Open up the configuration file, which is packaged with the
   software under '/upload/inc/config.inc.php', into a text editor
   (such as notepad). Edit the database configuration options to 
   match your database setup, and save the file.
   
   MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT ENTER A SINGLE LINE OR SPACE AT THE END
   OF THE FILE! SOME TEXT EDITORS AUTOMATICALLY ENTER A LINE AT
   THE BOTTOM OF FILES; THIS WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS.

2. Log into your web site via FTP (or some other file transfer 
   utility). Create a folder in your web site where you would like to 
   place the Lore software, such as '/lore' (this document
   will assume you are using '/lore').

3. Upload everything within the 'upload' folder to the '/lore'
   folder on your web site, exactly as it is shown on your local 
   computer. Make sure the subfolders within the 'upload' folder 
   are intact, meaning that you should end up with '/lore/cp', 
   '/lore/inc' etc. on your web site, with the respective files inside 
   each of those folders.

4. Set the directory '/lore/var/templates_c/' to world writeable. 
   Most FTP clients will allow you to do this - simply give the 
   'other' or 'world' group write and execute permission. Otherwise 
   you can telnet/ssh into your account (if available) and run the following 
   command (from within the '/lore' folder on your site):

	chmod 777 var/templates_c

5. Open your web browser and direct it to the install program where 
   you uploaded the software. Example: if you uploaded the software to 
   '/lore' and your domain name is example.com, point your web browser to: 
   
   http://example.com/lore/install/index.php

6. Follow the step by step instructions in the installation wizard.

7. Delete the '/lore/install' and the '/lore/upgrade' directories 
   and all of their contents, as they pose a security hazard. The 
   software will not run if the directories still exist.

8. Enjoy using Lore! Please use the technical support ticket system
   at http://pineappletechnologies.com/customers/ if you need any help.

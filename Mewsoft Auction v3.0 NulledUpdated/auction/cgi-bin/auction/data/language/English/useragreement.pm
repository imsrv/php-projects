This Agreement describes the terms and conditions applicable to your use of our services at  <!--CLASS::Site_Name--> (including the Great Collections category) and our general principles of our International  affiliates.    <P>We may amend this Agreement at any time by posting the amended terms on our   site. Except as stated below, all amended terms shall automatically be effective   30 days after they are initially posted on our site.    <OL>  	<B><LI>Membership Eligibility.</B><BR>  	Our services are available only to individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, our services are not available to minors. If you do not qualify, please do not use our services. Further, our services are not available to temporarily or indefinitely suspended      <!--CLASS::Site_Name--> members.<BR><BR>    	<B><LI>Fees and Services.</B><BR>  	Joining and bidding on items at <!--CLASS::Site_Name--> is free. Our Fees and Credits Policy is available      on the site and is incorporated by reference.  We may change our Fees and Credits Policy and the fees for our services from time to time. Our changes to the policy are effective after we provide you with at least fourteen (14) days' notice of the changes by posting the changes on the announcements board. However, we may choose to temporarily change our Fees and Credits Policy and the fees for our services for promotional events (for example, free listing days) and such changes are effective when we post the temporary promotional event on the announcements board. When you list an item you have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged for the use of our listing services. We may in our sole discretion change some or all of our services at any time. In the event we introduce a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. You are responsible for paying all fees associated with using our service and our website and all applicable taxes.<BR><BR>    	<B><LI><!--CLASS::Site_Name--> is Only a Venue.</B>  	<P><B>3.1 Overview.</B> Our site acts as the venue for sellers to list items (or, as appropriate, solicit offers to buy) and buyers to bid on items. We are not involved in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers. As a result, we have no control over the quality, safety or legality of the items advertised, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to buy items. We cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction.  	<P><B>3.2 Safe Trading.</B> Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult,      <!--CLASS::Site_Name--> cannot and does not confirm each user's purported identity. Thus, we have established a user-initiated feedback system to help you evaluate with whom you are dealing. We also encourage you to communicate directly with potential trading partners. You may also wish to consider using a third party escrow service or services that provide additional user verification.  	<P><B>3.3 Release.</B> Because we are not involved in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users, you release      <!--CLASS::Site_Name--> (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.  	<P><B>3.4 Information Control.</B> We do not control the information provided by other users which is made available through our system. You may find other user's information to be offensive, harmful, inaccurate, or deceptive. Please use caution, common sense, and practice safe trading when using our site. Please note that there are also risks of dealing with foreign nationals, underage persons or people acting under false pretense.<BR><BR>    	<B><LI>Bidding and Buying.</B><BR>  	If you are the highest bidder at the end of an auction (meeting the applicable minimum bid or reserve requirements) and your bid is accepted by the seller, you are obligated to complete the transaction with the seller, unless the item is listed in a category under the Non-Binding Bid Policy      or the transaction is prohibited by law or by this Agreement. By bidding on an item you agree to be bound by the conditions of sale included in the item's description (or linked to from the description) so long as those conditions of sale are not in violation of this Agreement or unlawful. Bids are not retractable except in exceptional circumstances such as when the seller materially changes the item's description after you bid, a clear typographical error is made, or you cannot authenticate the seller's identity. If you choose to bid on adult items, you are certifying that you have the legal right to purchase such items.<BR><BR>    	<B><LI>Listing and Selling.</B><BR>      <B><br>      5.1 Listing Description.</B> Listings may only include text descriptions, graphics and pictures you supply to our site (or that you link to from our site) that describe your item for sale (or as appropriate, for which are soliciting offers to buy). All listed items must be listed in an appropriate category. All Dutch auction items must be identical (the size, color, make, and model all must be the same for each item).   	<P><B>5.2 Binding Bids.</B> Except for items listed in a category under the Non-binding Bid Policy, if you receive at least one bid at or above your stated minimum price (or in the case of reserve auctions, at or above the reserve price), you are obligated to complete the transaction with the highest bidder upon the auction's completion, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the buyer fails to meet the terms of your listing (such as payment method), or (b) you cannot authenticate the buyer's identity.  	<P><B>5.3 Fraud.</B> Without limiting any other remedies, <!--CLASS::Site_Name-->      may suspend or terminate your account if you are found (by conviction, settlement, insurance or escrow investigation, or otherwise) to have engaged in fraudulent activity in connection with our site.  	<P><B>5.4 Manipulation.</B>  Neither bidders nor sellers may manipulate the price of any item nor may you interfere with other user's listings or auctions.<BR><BR>    	<B><LI>Your Information.</B><BR>  	"Your Information" is defined as any information you provide to us or other users in the registration, bidding or listing process, in any public message area (including the      feedback area) or through any email feature. You are solely responsible for Your Information, and we act as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of Your Information. With respect to Your Information:<P><B>6.1</B> Your Information (or any items listed therein): (a) shall not be false, inaccurate or misleading; (b) shall not be fraudulent or involve the sale of counterfeit or stolen items; (c) shall not infringe any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy; (d) shall not violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation (including without limitation those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, antidiscrimination or false advertising); (e) shall not be defamatory, trade libelous, unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing; (f) shall not be obscene or contain child pornography or, if otherwise adult in nature or harmful to minors, shall be posted only in the Adults Only section and shall be distributed only to people legally permitted to receive such content; (g) shall not contain any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information; (h) shall not create liability for us or cause us to lose (in whole or in part) the services of our ISPs or other suppliers; and      (i)   	shall not link directly or indirectly to or include descriptions of goods or services that:      (aa) are prohibited under this Agreement; (bb) are identical to other items you have up for auction but are priced lower than your item's reserve or minimum bid amount; (cc) are concurrently listed for auction on a web site other than      <!--CLASS::Site_Name-->'s; or (dd) you do not have a right to link to or include. Furthermore, you may not list any item on our site (or consummate any transaction that was initiated using our service) that, by paying to us the listing fee or the final value fee, could cause us to violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation, or that violates our current      Prohibited.  	<P><B>6.2</B> Solely to enable <!--CLASS::Site_Name--> to use the information you supply us with, so that we are not violating any rights you might have in that information, you agree to grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) right to exercise the copyright and publicity rights (but no other rights) you have in Your Information, in any media now known or not currently known, with respect to Your Information.      <!--CLASS::Site_Name--> will only use Your Information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.<BR><BR>      	<B><LI>Access and Interference.</B><BR>  	Our web site contains robot exclusion headers and you agree that you will not use any robot, spider, other automatic device, or manual process to monitor or copy our web pages or the content contained herein without our prior expressed written permission.

Much of the information on our site is updated on a real time basis and is proprietary or is licensed to      <!--CLASS::Site_Name--> by our users or third parties. You agree that you will not copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works, or publicly display any content (except for Your Information) from our website without the prior expressed written permission of      <!--CLASS::Site_Name--> or the appropriate third party.<BR><BR>    	<B><LI>Feedback.</B><BR>  	You may not take any actions that may undermine the integrity of the feedback system. If you earn a net feedback rating of      -5 (minus four), your membership will be automatically suspended, and you will be unable to list or bid.<P><B>8.1 Export.</B> You acknowledge that your feedback consists of comments left by other users and a composite feedback number compiled by      <!--CLASS::Site_Name-->, and that the composite number without the comments does not convey your full user profile.  Because feedback ratings are not designed for any purpose other than for facilitating trading between      <!--CLASS::Site_Name--> users, you agree that you shall not market or export your      <!--CLASS::Site_Name--> feedback rating in any venue other than <!--CLASS::Site_Name-->.  	<P><B>8.2 Import.</B> We do not provide the technical ability to allow you to import feedback from other websites to      <!--CLASS::Site_Name--> because a composite number, without the corresponding feedback does not reflect your true online reputation within our community.<BR><BR>    	<B><LI>Breach.</B><BR>  	Without limiting other remedies, we may immediately issue a warning, temporarily suspend, indefinitely suspend or terminate your membership and refuse to provide our services to you: (a) if you breach this Agreement or the documents it incorporates by reference; (b) if we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; or (c) if we believe that your actions may cause legal liability for you, our users or us.<BR><BR>    	<B><LI>No Warranty.</B><BR>      <b>  	WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS PROVIDE OUR WEB SITE AND SERVICES "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY.

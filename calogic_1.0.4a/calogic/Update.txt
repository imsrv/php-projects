CaLogic Update Instructions
===========================
The current version is 1.0.4a


For current users of CaLogic follow these instructions to update
your installation of CaLogic.

UPDATE INFO FOR ALL VERSIONS
============================

I have reorganized the directory structure of calogic a little.
The new directory: setup, will contain the setup files needed
to do an update, or a new installation. These files used to be in
the admin directory. Now, the admin directory only contains the 
settings.php file. So, if you have relocated the settings.php
file, you can omit the admin directory entirly.


UPDATE FROM VERSION 1.0.1a or 1.0.2a or 1.0.3a
===============================================

Upload all files except dbconfig.php in the include
directory and settings.php in the admin directory.
These files have not been changed.
You must reset the variables in the config.php file in the include
directory, as there have been changes to this file.

once the files are uploaded, run the update_1.0.3a.php file from
the setup directory:
http://www.yourdomain.com/calogic/setup/update_1.0.3a.php
for example.

This file corrects table errors and language table entries. 
No other changes have been made to the database structure.


Thats it.

See the Changes.log for information on program changes.
Read the readme_reminders.txt file for information on
setting up reminders.


UPDATE FROM VERSION 1.0.0a
================================

Upload all files except dbconfig.php in the include
directory and settings.php in the admin directory.
These files have not been changed.
You must reset the variables in the config.php file in the include

for example.

This file adds a field to the CaLogic contacts table, and corrects
a few other table errors and language table entries.

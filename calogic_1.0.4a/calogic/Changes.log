Version 1.0.1a

A major bug was reported to me and fixed. This bug made
every user an admin.... sorry about that.

Events can now be edited.

The day view now shows events.

The Time Zone Offset can now be set for your contacts. This
allows for reminders to be sent to your contacts at the right time.

Events are now shown expanding over the full durration of the event

the same time frame, this expansion cannot take place, and the events
are shown in the hour which they start.

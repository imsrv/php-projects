First you must expand the archive of the downloaded file to the directory of the server that your website resides. If you are using a unix shell, telnet in and copy the cms.zip file to the root of you web server. Generally it would be /var/www/html/ but if you don't know, ask you ISP.

If you received the tar archive and have shell access, place the archive where you want to install your website and type: tar xvfz cms.tar.gz

Now that the files are on the server, you should verify that the appropriate permissions.
chmod 777 templates
chmod 777 cache (and subdirectories)
chmod 777 config.php
chmod 777 spiderconfig.php 

If you do not have telnet access from your ISP, you will need to use a program such a WS-FTP to upload and set permissions to your files. Extract the cms.zip file to a folder keeping the directory structure. Ftp into your web server and upload the entire contents.

Change the permissions for the cache directories, config.php and spiderconfig.php files to 777 (Read/Write/Execute). 

Now that you have uploaded and set permissions for your files you need to run the install script. You access the install script via your web publisher but typing in the appropriate URL. For example: http://www.yourwebsite.com/cadmin/cinstall.php

1. What is eCorrei?
===================

eCorrei is a webmail system. This means it will allow you to access
your POP email account via the web. It can do (nearly) all the things
a normal email client can do: receiving mail, sending mail, replying,
forwarding, etc. eCorrei was designed to be fast, simple and platform
independent.

===========

	*	Support for both POP3 and IMAP;

	*	Receiving plain text messages, HTML messages, messages
		with attachments, HTML messages with attachments and
		HTML messages with inline images;

	*	Sending emails using a SMTP server or the PHP mail()
		function;

	*	Replying and forwarding of emails;

	*	Deleting emails, one or more at a time;

	*	Autorefresh of Inbox;

	*	Options for setting name and email address;

	*	Parsing of URL's in messages;

	*	Quickly send mails with smart maillinks in messages;

	*	Add signature to mails;
	
	*	Addressbook with groups to organize your addresses;

3. Translations
===============

eCorrei is currently available in 8 languages. If you would like to
translate eCorrei for me, send me a mail for instructions. Please
contact me before translating. Thanks in advance!


4. Reporting bugs
=================

If you think you've found a bug, please use the bug report system on
the website. Please tell which browser/PHP version/server you're using.
Before reporting, make sure you've got the required PHP environment
(check with check.php, see INSTALL) and your configuration is OK.
As I can't test eCorrei on all platforms/browsers/servers etc., I
would like you to mail me any testing results.

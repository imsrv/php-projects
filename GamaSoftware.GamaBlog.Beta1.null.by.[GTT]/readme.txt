Template system:
	To create new templates just click add. Once created you can put the $(dollar sign) then the template name into any template. You must also have things in load order though.  The template that you put the variable(the $templatename) in must be a higher load order than the template being called.

	To create options simply click add options. Once you have created an option you can call its contents by puting $(dollar sign) o (lowercase O) then the option name into any template. This will display the option value in any template (Ex $oaimname )

PopUp! Gallery 2.0 by Matthew Blake (http://www.darkhighway.net)


FILES and FOLDERS (abridged)

index.php -------- calls the script. customizable page.
popgal.php ------- creates thumbnails and indexes files. (do not edit)
popscript.js ----- creates popup windows. (do not edit)
popstyle.css ----- CSS styles that control the look of the thumbs and table.
popwin.php ------- larger images are passed to this document. (do not edit)
imgs/ ------------ images folder. (do not rename)
imgs/thumbs ------ thumbnails folder. (do not rename)


INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Open _vars.php and modify (optional).
2. Modify index.php to fit your web design. Leave link to javascript.php intact.
   Also do not remove "<?php require("album.php"); ?>" from body.
3. Create images and save them in corresponding locations. Note: full-size images and thumbnail images
   have the same name! Do not store any other files in "imgs" folder or "thumbs" subfolder.
4. Upload files to your web server using FTP program. It is best to create a new folder for contents.
   Leave the directory structure the same as it was extracted from winzip.
5. Point your browser to http://www.mydomain.com/gallerydirectory/index.php


CHANGELOG:

v2.0	- Corrected XHTML 1.0 transitional compliance/ tested in W3C's validator. 
	- Added better support for non-IE browsers (e.g. Netscape, Mozilla, Firefox...)
	- Rewrote window centering javascript.
	- Removed right-click oppression. You may install a no-right click script on "popwin.php"
v1.2	- Added "no right-click" option. Cleaned up code.
v1.1	- Separated script into four main files(_vars.php, album.php, index.php and javascript,php)


CUSTOMIZATION:

Change "index.php" to fit your website! I took the liberty of including a meta tag that removes the
annoying IE6 toolbar that appears over the images. You may omit this if you wish.
<meta http-equiv="imagetoolbar" content="no" />

Change number of columns in "index.php" in the php markup. There is a variable called "$cols" that
handles the table columns.
<?php $cols = "5"; require("popgal.php"); ?>

Change "popsytle.css" in order to modify the table background/image borders etc.

Version 3.0.4 released.  Slight change to the version numbering system.  Fixed bug which prevented it from working under PHP3.  Tuned up sections of the code, which should decrease execution time of the script. Fixed bug which prevented emoticons from working. Modified the quicktime support in sendcard so that it supports IE 5.5sp2 and IE6.

version 3.03 released.  Fixed a PHP 4.0.6 problem in mod_plugins.php, errors in the fancy.tpl, some bugs in functions.php and improved parts of sendcard.php.

Fix for magic file to recognize JPEG images
-------------------------------------------

As of 2000-03-23, the magic file that is packaged for Linux-Mandrake is missing
descriptors to identify JPEG images. The following lines can be added to
properly identify these images:

  # JPEG image patch by jeff b <jeff@univrel.pr.uconn.edu>
  6     string     JFIF     JPEG image data

If you are using file 3.30, please disregard this message -- they have fixed
that particular bug in that release.

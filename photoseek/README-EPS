To handle EPS documents, your system must be using ImageMagick's convert
utility.  In addition, ImageMagick relies upon Ghostscript to handle the
the EPS => Jpeg conversion for thumbnails.

Support for multi-part EPS documents is sketchy.  Please report all problems
you have with multi-part images.  Sample images are also very helpful.

I reccomend you test your system for EPS support beforehand to make sure you
have the necessary tools and they are indeed functional.  Try to convert some
of your EPS documents to Jpeg to ensure that it works:

	convert image.eps image.jpg
.

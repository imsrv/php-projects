Before following the directions, please make sure that you have Apache,
a supported SQL backend, and PHP3 or PHP4 installed on your system properly.
If these three components are not installed properly, Photoseek will not work.

* SECURE YOUR httpd.conf FILE
  This file is usually located in /etc/httpd/conf on most Redhat/Mandrake
  based systems, but is located elsewhere for SuSE, Slackware, etc. You
  must make sure that the first entry in the DirectoryIndex field is
  "index.php", or else PHP will not automatically serve up the proper
  file. The line will look like this:

    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.htm default.htm

  You must then be sure to associate the .php and .inc script extensions
  with PHP preprocessed scripts. You can do this by adding or changing
  this line:

    AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3 .phtml .php .inc

  if using PHP3, and

    AddType application/x-httpd-php .php3 .phtml .php .inc

  if using PHP4. You should then "HUP" Apache by issuing the command
  "killall -HUP httpd", which will cause Apache to re-read its
  configuration files.

* MAKE SURE PHPWEBTOOLS IS INSTALLED

  Photoseek depends on a package called phpwebtools, which can be grabbed
  from sourceforge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpwebtools/, and
  is available in tarball or RPM format.

* SET THE APPROPRIATE VARIABLES IN config.inc

  Change the database username and password to be correct for your
  MySQL server, and change the associative array of admin users/passwords
  to reflect the administration accounts you would like to have.

  You also should check to see if ImageMagick's "convert" utility is on
  your path. You can do this by using the command "which convert", which
  will not return anything if convert is not on your path. If this is the
  case, change the $convert_exec variable in config.inc to be equal to the
  absolute path and filename of convert (i.e. /usr/local/bin/convert).

  Before 0.2.2, Photoseek automagically detected the proper utilities and
  set their locations, but due to performance drops, the most popular
  locations of these utilities are now in config.inc, and will need to be
  changed for non-standard installations.

* CREATE THE DATABASE ON YOUR SQL SERVER

  Use the command "mysql -p < Photoseek.db.mysql" to import the
  Photoseek database definitions into MySQL. Other supported backends will
  have similarly named definition files. Consult your SQL server
  documentation on how to import the definitions. This will make sure that
  the backend is in place. You must do this prior to the first
  execution. Please note that you will have to run the definition file
  through perl if you want to use it with the GPL version of MySQL, since
  that version does not support TEXT types. The command would be:

    perl -pi -e "s|TEXT|BLOB||g;" Photoseek.db.mysql

* SECURE THE SCRIPTS

  A script called "catalog.sh" exists in the Photoseek install directory
  which allows repository discovering to be called from a shell. This
  is useful for cron scripts, etc. This can pose a security risk if left
  with world read/execute permissions. You also should set the proper
  information in this script if you intend to use it. The other script
  is "catalog-all.pl", which also contains information, such as passwords,
  which would be a security breach if left publically available. You
  should also secure this file.

* CREATE THE REPOSITORIES

  Before using the administration menu, please be sure that all of your
  images are accessable to the user that Apache/PHP runs under on your
  system. If not, execute
    chmod 644            (path to repository root) -Rvf
    chown (user).(group) (path to repository root) -Rvf
  which will set the permissions on all the files in your repository.

  Please note that repositories are more secure if located outside of
  your webserver root. This allows Photoseek to more easily handle
  security, as a publically available image can have no security
  constraints put on it from inside Photoseek. 

  To access the administration menu, you must enter a URL like the
  following (modified for your install location, of course):

    http://localhost/photoseek/admin.php
                   - or -
    http://localhost/photoseek/index.php?action=admin

  This will bring you to the administration menu if you enter the
  correct admin username and password. From here, you will want to
  add one or more repositories. The repository path should, as of
  0.1.1, end with a trailing slash (/), or else you will have
  cataloging errors. This should have been fixed by 0.1.3.

* DISCOVERING THE REPOSITORIES

  You will want to "discover" your new repositories before making
  the database available to people. You can do this by selecting a
  repository in the admin menu and telling it to catalog. If this
  process is repeated, all additions/corrections/deletions will be
  committed to the database.

<tr><td>PLEASE READ THIS MEMBER AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES. BY CLICKING ON THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON BELOW, YOU AGREE TO BECOME BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU WILL NOT HAVE ANY RIGHT TO USE THE SERVICES. ACCEPTANCE BY {SITE_NAME} ("{SITE_DNS}") IS EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED UPON YOUR ASSENT TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER TERMS; IF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE CONSIDERED AN OFFER BY {SITE_NAME} ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO THESE TERMS.
<br><br>
This Agreement is a legal document that details your rights and obligations as a {SITE_NAME} member entitled to a member account and to access and use certain of {SITE_NAME}'s services ("Services"). You cannot become a member until you have accepted the terms of this Agreement. The Agreement provides very important information about your membership and the Services, so you should take the time to read and understand it. If you have questions about the Agreement, or about your rights and responsibilities as a member, please contact us at {SITE_EMAIL}. You should also take the time to review the {SITE_NAME} Privacy Policy which reflects {SITE_NAME}'s current privacy policies. The Internet and online world is changing rapidly and as technology and triblalgames.net's business continue to evolve, these policies may have to be updated or revised. Since the Privacy Policy may change, you should check for the most current version at {SITE_URL}.
<br><br>
For the same reasons, it may be necessary for {SITE_URL} to update or revise certain provisions of this Agreement. By accepting this Agreement and becoming a member you agree that {SITE_NAME} may change the terms of this Member Agreement. If {SITE_NAME} makes material changes or revisions to this Agreement, {SITE_NAME} will provide notice to you, via the e-mail address you provided upon registration, fifteen days in advance of the changes taking effect (when possible). Your continued use of Services after notification of changes means that you accept the changes. If you do not want to accept the changes proposed by {SITE_NAME} of any of the terms in this Agreement, your only remedy is to cancel your membership and cease using all Services.

<tr><td>

<br><br>

This Agreement is your entire agreement with {SITE_NAME} and governs your use of the Services. There may be additional terms and conditions if you use affiliate services, other {SITE_NAME} services or products, or third-party software and/or services. To be a member, and receive Services you must be at least 18 years old. If you are not 18 years old but you are at least 13 years old, you may still receive Services, but only if your account was created and registered by your parent or guardian. Further, you may only become a member if you live in a country or other political division that permits membership, and if United States law permits such membership. This Agreement will be void and without effect, and you will not be entitled to any Services, if you do not satisfy these age and jurisdiction requirements.
<br><br>
You will receive an account that is uniquely associated with your membership. All of your access to Services will be through that account, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement. You agree to comply with the limits set on your account by your type of membership. You further agree to comply with all the rules for creation and use of Teams. Failure to comply with these rules will result in termination of your accounts and membership.
<br><br>
As a member you are responsible for all activity on your account and on any sub-accounts. Violations or warnings accrued by a sub-account can lead to termination of that sub-account or your account. If warnings or violations are received by sub-accounts, your account will also receive notification. You may also receive important notices about your membership from time to time that may not be provided to the sub-accounts, so it is important for you to regularly check the email address you provided when you registered. Because you are responsible for all use of your account, you must supervise the use of your account by others. Sub-account users are responsible for complying with all of the terms of this Agreement and the rules for the {SITE_NAME}, and you may not allow someone to use a sub-account if they would not otherwise qualify for an account (e.g., they are underage). It is important that you not reveal your password to others. You agree not to reveal your password to others and you agree to indemnify and hold {SITE_NAME} harmless for any improper or illegal use of your account. This includes illegal or improper use by someone to whom you have given permission to use your account. Your account may be terminated if you let someone use it inappropriately. If your membership is terminated for any reason, {SITE_NAME} is under no obligation to offer Services or another membership to you in the future.

<tr><td align="center" class="headline">2. ONLINE CONDUCT AND CONTENT</td></tr>
Content

</td></tr>

<tr><td>

<br><br>
By content, we mean the text, software, communications, images, sounds and other information provided online. Most content in the {SITE_NAME} is provided by {SITE_NAME}, our members, our affiliates, or independent content providers under license. In general, {SITE_NAME} does not pre-screen content available in the {SITE_NAME}. {SITE_NAME} does not assume any responsibility or liability for content that is provided by others. {SITE_NAME} does reserve the right to remove content that, in {SITE_NAME}'s judgment, does not meet its standards or does not comply with the Agreement, but {SITE_NAME} is not responsible for any failure or delay in removing such material. Keep in mind that {SITE_NAME} is not responsible for content available on the Internet, although we reserve the right to block access to any Internet area containing illegal or other harmful content or otherwise being used for purposes that are unlawful or injurious to {SITE_NAME} or its members.
<br><br>
{SITE_NAME} encourages Members to participate and express their views. But it is important to remember that there are rules and standards that you must abide by as a Member. This means that if you, or anyone using your account, violate the Agreement, {SITE_NAME} may take action against your account, ranging from the issuance of a warning to the termination of your account. You understand that {SITE_NAME} is not required to provide notice prior to terminating your account for violating these rules and standards, but it may choose to do so.
<br><br>
{SITE_NAME} applies the same standards to its own and its partners' content that it applies to member content. Remember that community standards vary from community to community. However, in most places in the {SITE_NAME}, vulgar language and sexually explicit conduct are no more appropriate online than they would be at a family dinner. For examples of appropriate online behavior, please see our Behavior Guidelines at http://www.there.com.
<br><br>
Obey the rules wherever you are. This includes state, local, federal laws, or foreign or international law where appropriate. Ignorance of the law is no excuse.
<br><br>
Illegal behavior
<br><br>
You will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances as a condition of your membership. {SITE_NAME} will terminate your accounts and membership upon receiving reliable information involving your violation of any law, and will cooperate with law enforcement agencies on such matters. {SITE_NAME} may monitor the {SITE_NAME} to enforce the rules and policies of {SITE_NAME}, to detect or verify illegal activity, and to cooperate with law enforcement agencies. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND WAIVE ANY EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY AS TO ANY OF YOUR ACTIVITY IN THE {SITE_NAME}.
<br><br>
E-mail, Advertisements, Use of Member Information
<br><br>
Your membership allows you to send and receive e-mail to and from other members and users of the Internet. You may not use the Services to send unsolicited bulk e-mail, junk e-mail, chain letters or "spam". You may place advertisements only in areas designated for that purpose. Unsolicited advertising is not allowed. You must have permission from {SITE_NAME} and/or the person to whom you are sending the advertisement.
<br><br>
You may not harvest or collect information, including screen names, about other members or users of the {SITE_NAME}. The use of any information learned through the Services or while in the {SITE_NAME} is limited to the express purposes set forth in this Agreement and the rules for the {SITE_NAME}; all other uses, including, without limitation, sending unsolicited bulk e-mail, are strictly prohibited.
<br><br>
Any violation of these provisions will subject your account and membership to immediate termination and further legal action. If you have received unsolicited bulk e-mail and want to report it, use the Forward button on the e-mail screen and send the e-mail to help@{SITE_NAME}; however, {SITE_NAME} cannot guarantee that it can prevent your receipt of all such e-mail. {SITE_NAME} also reserves the right to take any and all legal and technical remedies to prevent unsolicited bulk e-mail from entering, utilizing or remaining within the {SITE_NAME}.
<br><br>
Proprietary Rights
<br><br>
Much of the content available through the Services or in the {SITE_NAME} is owned by others, and is protected by copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. Any content that you upload or download while using the Service must be authorized; this means you must have the legal right to upload or download the content. You must not copy, transmit, modify, distribute, show in public or in private or create any derivative works from any of the content you find in the {SITE_NAME}, unless you have the legal right to do so. Making unauthorized copies of any content can lead to the termination of your account and may subject you to further legal action beyond the termination of your membership by {SITE_NAME} or other content owners. You agree to indemnify and hold {SITE_NAME} and its subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, employees, officers, directors and agents from any claims made by third parties relating to your use of any content.
<br><br>
{SITE_NAME} will comply with all copyright laws, and will take steps to remove all content that infringes third party copyright. Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. 512, {SITE_NAME} has established a designated agent and a procedure for reporting and responding to claims of copyright infringement. This procedure can be found at help@{SITE_NAME}.
<br><br>
Submissions
<br><br>
{SITE_NAME} is pleased to hear from its members and welcomes your comments regarding the Services and the {SITE_NAME}. We request that you be specific in your comments on those services and products.
<br><br>
All materials you send to {SITE_NAME}, whether or not at our request (including, but not limited to, e-mail, postings, contest entries, Avatars, There Objects, creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts or other information) (collectively, "Submissions"), shall be deemed, and shall remain, the property of {SITE_NAME}. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of {SITE_NAME} and {SITE_NAME} shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, {SITE_NAME} shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Submissions of every kind and nature, in perpetuity, throughout the world and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Submissions. You waive any and all moral rights in any such Submissions as well as any claim to a right of credit or approval

You shall keep confidential and not disclose to any third party or use (except as part of using the Services and the {SITE_NAME}) any non-public information obtained from {SITE_NAME} or as part of your use of the Services and the {SITE_NAME} ("Confidential Information").

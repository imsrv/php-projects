2.0 About Relata
----------------

Relata is a CRM platform that currently features a sales force
automation module, with additional CRM modules currently being
developed. Relata has user and administrative interfaces. Being
web-based, the interface for Relata is a current version of a
standard web-browser. 

The Relata source code is released under the GPL, and makes use of
the programming languages PHP and Javascript. We have chosen to use
Javascript and PHP because our development team believes in making
our source code accessible to as broad an audience as possible. Both
Javascript and PHP have a rapidly growing developer base because of
their ease of use. 

We have made Relata completely web-based in order that it may be run
without having to install special client software – something of
specific value to IT managers who want to deploy Relata in an
organization with many users. 

Relata allows you to manage your contacts and accounts from one
integrated web interface. Sales professionals can use Relata to
organize and manage their customers and accounts with ease and
powerful functionality.

Relata is highly scalable and is appropriate for use in the 
enterprise. 

Relata can be customized to run with any SQL database. 

Using Relata, you have the power to create custom fields, manage sales
opportunities, associate your contacts with various categories (groups)
- e.g. ‘Computer Salespeople’. By adding this functionality, Relata
allows you to perform rapid queries on key variables, communicating
with your contacts in a more targeted and efficient capacity. You can
send email to your specific groups simultaneously with important
information - saving you from emailing each contact individually.

Relata also records and tracks all your communications with your
contacts, giving you a more precise history of each relationship,
allowing you to extract more information and value from your database.

With built-in support for opportunities, users are able to avoid losing
out on potential sales. Easily associate a particular contact with an
opportunity using point-and-click functionality. You can keep track of
the various sales stages associated with a sale and the probability of
a sale with ease.

Relata also allows you to better organize and prioritize your short-
term and long-term activities using the to-do and calendar features.
You can plan ahead with Relata: enter events or to-do items ahead of
time and print out your daily to-do schedule and calendar whenever you
require it. 

Relatamail is free and released under the GNU General Public License. 

It is complete with fully commented source code.

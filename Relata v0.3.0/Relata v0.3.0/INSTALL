1.0 Operating System and Environment Settings
---------------------------------------------

You need a MySQL server or PostgreSQL server, and an Apache web server
(all of which can be run on the same physical server).

MySQL: We have done our development & testing with MySQL, version (3.23.32). 
The latest "development" version of MySQL has not been tested, though it may work fine.

Apache: We use the lastest build of Apache, version 1.3.23.  
Although running an older version is not recommened for security reasons, 
there should be no problems doing so.

PHP: PHP needs to have MySQL or PostgreSQL support compiled in.

If you don't have the above settings currently on your web server,
we have included a script called "web-install" in the "scripts"
directory that should help you get things going. If you decide to
use that script, carefully read through the top section to make
sure you set it up properly for your server.  Also, you will need to
download the software packages and put them in their apropriate place
according to the "web-install" script, before your run it.

** Win32 Users: Read the 'WIN32.USERS.README' document.

2.0 Relata Database Setup
-------------------------

Relata currently uses a MySQL/PostgreSQL database (db) called "relata".  
In setting up this db, please use the mysql.relata.sql/pgsql.relata.sql text file
placed in the "scripts" directory to setup the required set of tables.  The tables 
themselves have been defined in ways to ensure efficient and reliable data access.

Relata security relies heavily upon database security, in particular, 
secure access to the "relata" db.  It is very important that the acting MySQL db server 
administrator sets up appropriate privilege systems for the Relata administrator.

All Relata administrative functionality is kept in the "wwwroot/admin" directory, while all 
Relata user functionality is kept in the "wwwroot/user" directory. 

We HIGHLY insist you edit the files "mysql/pgsql.*.table.sql" and read the comments in them.  
After you've done that, the MySQL db server administrator can INSERT them with the following 
instructions.

If you want to change the name of the database, do so.  Then call 'mysql' with the new DB 
name when doing the following input pipes for table population.

** DO NOT JUST RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS! **

Please look in the "scripts/mysql/pgsql*.table.sql" files and follow the directions in them.  

MySQL:

mysqladmin create relata
mysql relata < mysql.relata.sql
mysql mysql < mysql.user.table.sql
mysql mysql < mysql.db.table.sql

At anytime you can change a MySQL account password as follows:	
'mysqladmin -u username password new-password-here'

PostgreSQL instructions:

Welcome to psql, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

       \? for help on internal slash commands
       \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
       \q to quit

relata=> \i pgsql.user_admin.tbl.sql

3.0 Administrative Setup
------------------------

It is assumed that the individual who will downloaded and setup Relata will act as the 
Relata administrator.  

We recommend, if you don't have experience with Apache access permission settings, 
that you read up on them at the following URLS.

http://www.apacheweek.com/features/userauth
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_access.html
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_auth.html

The following is an example to protect your web directory structure.

<VirtualHost 192.168.0.1>
  ServerName www.domain.tld
  ServerAlias domain.tld
  DocumentRoot /www/hosts/domain.tld/relata/wwwroot
  ServerAdmin webmaster@domain.tld
  ScriptAlias  /cgi-bin/  /www/hosts/domain.tld/cgi-bin
  <Directory /www/hosts/domain.tld/cgi-bin>
      AllowOverride None
      Options ExecCGI
  </Directory>
  <Directory /www/hosts/domain.tld/relata/wwwroot>
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all
      AllowOverride None
      Options Indexes IncludesNOEXEC SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
  </Directory>
  <Directory /www/hosts/domain.tld/relata/wwwroot/admin>
      Order Deny,Allow
	# For greater security, restrict your administrative use
	# to only be allowed from subnet's or hostnames
      Allow from 192.168.0.
      AuthType Basic
      AuthName "Relata Admin"
	# This next file is the file that contains your generated
	# login information with htpasswd
      AuthUserFile /www/hosts/domain.tld_passwd
      Require valid-user
      AllowOverride None
      Options Indexes IncludesNOEXEC SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

4.0 How to Create a User
------------------------

Only the Relata administrator is able to add new users.
The administrator can set himself/herself up as a user as well.

The following are the steps that are required by the administrator when 
registering a new Relata user.

	1.  Load up the Relata interface.
	2.  Enter an username and password and then click 'add'.

Note that the adminstrator will set up an initial password for the new user.  
The user can then change this password after he/she logs in for the first time.

5.0 config.inc.php
------------------

// the root dir. You must include a trailing /
$_PHPLIB["basedir"] = "/usr/www/apache/htdocs/relata-0.2.6/wwwroot/";

// this is the web dir. You must include a trailing /
$_PHPLIB["webdir"] = "http://www.hostname.tld/relata-0.2.6/wwwroot/";

// Database settings
$db_type = "mysql";	// 'pgsql' or 'mysql'
$db_name = "relata";
$db_host = "localhost";
$db_username = "root";
$db_password = "";

// SMTP host - leave as localhost unless mail server resides on external server
$smtp_host="localhost";

// Path to PHP binary
$php_path="/www/php/bin/php"; //path to PHP binary
// Windows 9x: "c://php//bin//php.exe"

//url for web page redirection  (ie. //http://www.hostname.tld/.../response/r.php)
$redirect_url="http://www.hostname.tld/relata-0.2.6/group_email/response/r.php";

// TABLE NAMES
$account		= "account";
$activity		= "activity";
$activity_link	= "activity_link";
$contact_opportunity = "contact_opportunity";

$contact 		= "contact";
$contact_account= "contact_account";
$contact_group	= "contact_group";
$contact_xfield	= "contact_xfield";
$extra_field	= "extra_field";
$group			= "groups";
// if you modify any of the above variables in this block, then you will have to manually modify
// contact/lib.php

$opportunity	= "opportunity";
$relata_user	= "relata_user";
$sales_stage	= "sales_stage";
$message = "message";
$blast_log = "blast_log";
$contact_message = "contact_message";

$group_message_vars = "group_message_vars";
// if you modify the table name of group_message_vars, then you will have to manually
// edit lib/group_email_class.php accordingly
 These variables are used by Relata and ONLY THE RELATA 
 ADMINISTRATOR SHOULD BE ABLE TO SET AND CHANGE THEM WHENEVER 
 APPROPRIATE.

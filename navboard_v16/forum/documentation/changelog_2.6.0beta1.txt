CHANGELOG

Released 5/22/2003

IMPROVEMENTS:
-all occurences of 'thread' changed to 'topic',
more user friendly
-static topic ids, never changes except when
moving to another forum, no speed loss
-bookmarked posts so you can jump to
a specific post in a topic
-option to have reply counts managed
done during posting rather than counted
when displaying the forums, for faster
view of main forum list
-listing of forums is stored in a file
to make display much faster, this also
allows for ordering
-graphical poll bars (thanks to Leon The Pro)
-reverse post view on replys, no more
iframe
-faster bbcode/smilie performance (translations
all done at the same time instead of 
individually)
-ip logged centered vertically in posts
-forum ordering
-improved admin control panel look
-pages used instead of topicstart and
poststart
-page can be set as 'last'
-buddy list shows last location of users on list
-much improved theme system, templates,
many more options in css file
-revamped variable usage, files only retrieved
once per page instead of multiple times, gives
a noticable speed increase
-moved pm notice to footer
-hightlights in posts for search terms
-quote design controlled by css now
-attachments linked in status page
-config moved to default admin page, takes less
time to load than status
-profile button hidden when not logged in

copy/delete an entire directory and all files

posts
-replying to a topic with deleted posts overwrites 
certain posts 
-admins may have been unable to update members list
per page or search results per page settings 
-end textarea tag messes up post box when editing

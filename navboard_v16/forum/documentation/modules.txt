MODULES

========

all modules have their own folder like /modules/members
which hold all php files and images

========

each module must have a config.php file for navboard to load
which must contain the following variables anything else in the 
config.php file is optional

$moduleconfig['mainpage']="whatever.php";
//relative to module folder
//what navboard loads

$moduleconfig['active']="yes"; //OPTIONAL
//module active? default is yes
//when no the module wont show up to end user

$moduleconfig['adminpage']="whatever.php";  //OPTIONAL
//relative to module folder
//admin page for if your module needs a admin page

see included modules for examples

========

all module data should be stored in the 
'$configarray[20]/modulename' folder (no exceptions)
using the write/delete/get functions from navboard
this folder will have to be made by the module itself
with permissions octdec(777) for compatibility,
navboard createdir function may be used

========

style of the module must conform with the css style sets
setup by navboard themes

========

admin modules do not include header and footer in the script
while regular modules need to include the header and footer
so that they can make their own link bar and page title

========

if you need to use multiple pages in your module, you can
set up your config.php file to change the mainfile location
based on variables rather than one static page

========

INCLUDE WARNING: When you want to include a file into
a module, by default it will take try to get the file from
the main forum directory (this is because the module is not
run from its own directory, it is run from modules.php), if 
you want to include a file from a module directory you will 
have to use the path to modules 'modules/(modulename)/(file)'

========

CONFIG REMINDER: the config.php file is included when showing the
module buttons, so to ensure highest speed, ONLY include
the variables required as instructed by the beginning of
this file, put other things like creating directories and 
getting file information in another global file for the
module

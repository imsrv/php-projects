Setup instructions:

First things first:

Open sitegen.pl in a TEXT editor. Edit these lines towards the top of the script.

Change the very first line in the script to point to the perl interpreter on
your server. Use the following command to find perl 5 on your server:

whereis perl5

Next edit the below lines:

# add your email here. do not forget the \ in front of the @.
$email = "nuclei\@eisa.net.au";

# URL to the directory this script is running from.
$urltodir = "http://adultstorage.com/test";

# Auto submit to Search Engines? (1 for yes - 2 for no)
$submit= "1";

# Path to your sendmail program.
$mailprogram = "/usr/sbin/sendmail -t";
 
to get the path to sendmail use the following command:

whereis sendmail


Okay thats the important script stuff. Now on to the rest.

#1.  edit banners.txt, format is 

banner1.jpg#http://sponsor.url.com/
banner2.jpg#http://sponsor.url.com/

for each banner and url put a line.  then copy all banner images to banners/


#2.  edit grfx.txt,  this file conains color scheme groups.. like

blk
wht

Then, for all your logo's and background images, rename them with the color group
as the first part of the filename, like if you have a black background and a logo
for black backgrounds name them blackbg123.jpg and blacklogo.jpg and stick them
in the backgrounds/ and logo/ directories.  example:

contents of grfx.txt:

blk
wht

contents of directory backgrounds/:

blkimg1.jpg
blkbg.jpg
blkblah.jpg
whtblaj.jpg
whtimg23.jpg
whtbg.jpg

contents of directory logos/:

blklogo213.jpg
blklogo23.jpg
blkimg.jpg
whtre3d.jpg
wht33.jpg

then it will use a random matching image from each directory, so you can use a black
background with a logo built for a black bg. make sense? The other alternative is to set
up matched groups of images like gr1 gr2 gr3 gr4 etc. then make the first 3 characters 
gr1 gr2 gr3 etc. to keep groups together. easy enough?


#3.  Page templates. there is an example template in the templates/ dir.  just follow
the format of this file, each time you put %banner% in the template it will put a random
banner. Anytime you put a %sitename% in the templates it will add the sitename. Make all 
the templates you want and stick them in the templates dir, the script will do the rest.

If you want a seperate content page, make the page and put it in the content/ directory
it is suggested you call content for ALL pages you create from one location to save disk
space and assuming this much we dont have this script set to copy content images, only 
content pages. This script does NOT pass the banner and sitename variables to content 
pages in this release. It will do so soon as well as allow more pages all hyperlinked 
to each other.


#4. Upload all files and directories exactly as they were in the zip file. Make sure 
that the .txt and .pl, .cgi, .pm files are uploaded in ASCII mode. Upload graphics in 
binary mode.


#5. Chmod all file correctly.

Make sure the directory where the script resides is chmod 777 so the script
can create directories for each site in it.

all script specific stuff is as follows:
Go into the directory this script resides and make the following chmod's:

chmod 777 backgrounds
chmod 777 banners
chmod 777 content
chmod 777 logos
chmod 777 templates
chmod 777 banners.txt
chmod 777 grfx.txt
chmod 775 sitegen.pl


#6.  Run the script.  After you have set all that up, all you have to do is run the 
script for each page you want to create.  

Type in telnet:

perl sitegen.pl <directoryname>  "site name"

with the quotes if the name is more than 1 word. 

Example:

perl sitegen.pl sexsite1 "Sex Site 1"

Hit enter key.


The script will then create the page in sites/<directoryname>/ 
and copy all the files and images it needs there.
Be patient, the script can take several minutes to work.

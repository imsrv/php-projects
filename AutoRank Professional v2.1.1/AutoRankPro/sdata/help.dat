NEW

$HELPINFO::PAGE{'MAIL'} = <<'MAIL';
<b><font size="2" color="#000099">Sending Mail</font></b>
<p>
From this page you can send e-mail to one or more of your members.  This
page allows you to select a single member, multiple members, or all members
to send the e-mails to.
<p>
<b>Selecting Recipients</b>
<p>
The Send To: field allows you to select your recipients.  If you want to send
e-mail to all members, select the first option - "All Members".  If you want
to send e-mail to a single member, select only that member.  If you want to send
the e-mail to multiple members, but not all of them, hold the ctrl key down
on your keyboard while you click on the members you want to send to.
<p>
<b>Sending The E-mail</b>
<p>
Once you have selected who you want to send to, the subject of your message, and
entered your message, you are ready to sent the e-mail.  All you have to do is 
press the Send Email button.  Once you do this, you will be immediately returned
to the main page - the e-mails will be sent in the background.
MAIL

$HELPINFO::PAGE{'EMAILS'} = <<'EMAILS';
<b><font size="2" color="#000099">Listing E-mails</font></b>
<p>
This page will allow you to get a list of all your member's e-mail addresses.
This can be useful for use with external e-mail clients.
<p>
<b>Seperating Character</b>
<p>
In this field you will enter the character to seperate the e-mail addresses
with. For example, if you enter "," you will get a list like:
<p>
email@site.com, email2@site2.com, etc
<p>
Use &lt;br&gt; if you want them listed one on top of another.
EMAILS

$HELPINFO::PAGE{'ERRLOG'} = <<'ERRLOG';
<b><font size="2" color="#000099">Error Log</font></b>
<p>
This page will display all of the errors that the script has experienced.
Most of the time this log should be fairly small, assuming you have properly
installed the software.
<p>
<b>Permission Denied Error</b>
<p>
The permission denied error indicates that improper permissions have been
set on a file or directory.  Double check your permissions settings and make
sure they are correct for your server.
<p>
<b>No Such File or Directory Error</b>
<p>
This indicates the script could not find the file/directory it was looking for.
Generally this means you have not setup your directory paths properly.
<p>
<b>Resource Temporarily Unavailable</b>
<p>
This is not a bad error to receive in most cases.  It just indicates that two 
users were trying to access the same database at the same time.  The script will
not allow this (assuming you are using the GDBM version).  This is good because
it will prevent corruption of your databases.
ERRLOG

$HELPINFO::PAGE{'CHTLOG'} = <<'CHTLOG';
<b><font size="2" color="#000099">Cheating Log</font></b>
<p>
This page will allow you to view a log of possible cheating attempts.  It
is important to note that these are only <b>possible</b> cheating attemps.
You should do some further investigation, and not just rely on this information
to accuse your members.  This data is a good starting point, but some of the
data that is logged is just a person accidently doing things that appear to
be cheating.
<p>
<b>Clearing The Log</b>
<p>
You should clear this log every so often, as it can get very large if you don't
keep your eyes on it.  To clear the log, just press the Clear Cheat Log button.
<p>
<b>Multiple Click Cheat</b>
<p>
This message indicates that a person clicked through multiple times in a row for
an account.  The account ID is listed so you can track down which accounts are
trying to boost their count.
<p>
<b>Double CGI Cheat</b>
<p>
This message indicates that a member tried to circumvent the Double CGI cheat 
protection of the script.  This usually means they tried to embed the link to
your site in a img tag or something similar.
CHTLOG

$HELPINFO::PAGE{'BREAKS'} = <<'BREAKS';
<b><font size="2" color="#000099">Editing List Breaks</font></b>
<p>
This is the page where you can edit the HTML that appears in your list
breaks.  You must have entered some list breaks in setup.cgi in order
to use this function.
<p>
<b>Saving HTML</b>
<p>
To save some HTML for a list break, all you need to do is enter the HTML
into the provided space.  Once you have entered the HTML, select which
break it is you want to save this HTML for.  Now you can press the Save
Break button and your HTML will be recorded.
<p>
<b>Loading HTML</b>
<p>
If you have already setup HTML for a list break and want to make changes
to it, all you need to do is select the list break you are wanting to 
edit.  Once you have selected that break, press the Load Break button and
your HTML will appear in the box.  You can then edit and save it as per the
instructions above.
<p>
<b>Notes</b>
<p>
Some things to remember about list breaks:<p>
- You cannot put a textarea tag into any list break<br>
- If you are using a table for your rankings, you will need to include
the proper table code in the list break so it will appear in the proper
location.  Usually this consists of starting a new table row, entering
your HTML wrapped in a td tag, and then closing out the table row.
<p>
Some sample list breaks have been included with the documentation.  See
the samples.html file for more information
BREAKS

$HELPINFO::PAGE{'BACKUP'} = <<'BACKUP';
<b><font size="2" color="#000099">Backing Up Databases</font></b>
<p>
This page is where you will be able to backup your databases so you can
be sure not to loose any data.  This will also be useful if you move to 
a new server, as it will make importing your databases trivial.
<p>
<b>Selecting Backup Files</b>
<p>
All databases will be backed up to plain text files.  On this page there
are three fields you need to fill in.  They will all be the names of the
files you want to backup the data to, or the names of the files you want
to import saved data from.  If you are backing up, these files will be 
placed in the script data directory;  if you are restoring, these files
will need to be placed in the script data directory before begining the
restoration process.
<p>
<b>Backing Up Data</b>
<p>
Once you have selected the filenames you want to backup to, just press the
Backup Data button.  Three files will be created in your sdata directory,
and you will need to download those in ASCII mode to your local computer.
<p>
<b>Restoring Data</b>
<p>
To restore data you will need to upload your backup files to the sdata directory
in ASCII mode.  Once they have all been uploaded, enter their filenames in the
appropriate boxes, then press the Restore Data button.  Your data will be restored
and the list will be ready for normal operations.
BACKUP

$HELPINFO::PAGE{'SETUP'} = <<'SETUP';
<b><font size="2" color="#000099">Script Setup</font></b>
<p>
This page is where you will setup the basic variables for the script.
All of the variables should have adequate descriptions below them, including
an example setting.  This should be enough to get you going.  Here we will
only discuss a few of the checkbox options.
<p>
<b>Forward surfers to a random ranking page?</b><br>
This option, if checked, will make the script choose a random page from your
"Page List:" value to forward surfers to.  Each surfer will be forwarded to 
a random page.  If you check this, you do not need to fill in the "Forward URL"
value.
<p>
<b>Log Errors?</b><br>
If this option is checked, all error messages that the script generates will
be logged.  This only logs fatal errors (ie if a file cannot be accessed).
Data errors are not logged;  cheating attempts are always logged.
<p>
<b>Use double CGI cheat protection?</b><br>
If this option is checked, surfers will be forwarded to a gateway page before
they make it to your main ranking pages.  This gateway will verify that a real
surfer is clicking through, and it is not a cheating attempt by the member.
<p>
<b>Review new additions before listing?</b><br>
If this option is checked, accounts will not be instantly added.  You will have
to approve all signups before they can be listed on your site.
<p>
<b>Mark new sites with an icon?</b><br>
If this option is checked, a "new" icon will be displayed next to sites that
have recenly signed up.  If you check this box you will need to fill in the
URL to your new icon, and the number of seconds to display them for.

$HELPINFO::PAGE{'HTML'} = <<'HTML';
<b><font size="2" color="#000099">Editing Your HTML</font></b>
<p>
This function allows you to setup a header, footer, and template to use for the page(s) you select.
A complete description of templates can be found in the templates.html file included with the
script distribution.  A description of how to edit the header and footer is included in the
install.html file under "After Installation".  We will briefly cover the header, footer, and template
here as well.
<p>
<b>The Template</b>
<p>
Editing the template is probably one of the most complicated parts of the script.  It does, however, make
the script extremely easy to integrate into your site.  If you haven't already, you should first read over
the templates.html file included with the software.
<p>
The first time you go to edit the template, there will be a default value in place.  That default will
work fine, but you may want to modify it for your site.  Notice that the default contains the HTML for
only one ranking.  This is required!  If you find yourself inserting any script values more than once in
the template, then you are probably doing something wrong.  Basically what happens is the script reads
in your template, then replaces all of the values surrounded by #%%# with the proper data.  The
possible script values are:

<p>

#%RANK%# - The site's current rank<br>
#%FONT_SIZE%# - The font size to use, from setup.cgi<br>
#%BANNER%# - The site's banner<br>
#%TITLE%# - The site's title<br>
#%IN%# - The number of hits sent BY the site<br>
#%OUT%# - The number of hits sent TO the site<br>
#%DESC%# - The description of the site<br>
#%NEW%# - This will place a new icon<br>
#%URL%# - This is the outgoing URL for the account<br>
#%PREVRANK%# - This is the site's previous rank<br>
#%PREVIN%# - This is site's previous hits in value<br>
#%CAT%# - This is the site's category<br>
#%ICONS%# - This will display icons for the site

<p>

Insert those in the way you want them to appear, and the script will use them for each of the ranks
that are going to appear on that page.  We have also included a few samples with the software distribution.  
Those are all located in the docs/samples directory which should have been created when you un-zipped the archive.
<p>
<b>The Header</b>
<p>
In this box you will enter all of the HTML that you want to come before the list of posts.  You
can enter any HTML you want, except for a textarea tag.
<p>
<b>The Footer</b>
<p>
In this box you will enter all of the HTML that you want to come after the list of posts.  You
can enter any HTML you want, except for a textarea tag.
<p>
<b>Header/Footer Template</b>
<p>
There are some template values that you can insert into the header and footer for the site of the
moment, last updated time, and total members in your database.  Those values are:
<p>
#%UPDATE%# - The last updated time<br>
#%NEXTUP%# - The time the next re-rank will occur<br>
#%TOTAL%# - Total members in the database<br>
#%TITLE%# - Title for the site of the moment<br>
#%DESC%# - Description for the site of the moment<br>
#%BANNER%# - Banner for the site of the moment<br>
#%URL%# - Outgoing URL for the site of the moment<br>
#%ICONS%# - Icons for the site of the moment
<p>
<b>Saving The Data</b>
<p>
Once you have the HTML entered as you want it, you will need to save it.  This can be done by pressing
the Update HTML button near the bottom of the page.  You will also need to select what pages to use the
HTML for.  If you select "Use for this page only" the HTML will be used for only the page that you
selected (this is listed at the top of this page).  If you select "Use for all pages" then the HTML you
entered will be used for all of your pages.

Here are the 3 files which have to run once a day, for sending jobmails, resumemails, delete expired jobs and plannings:
[script_path]/admin/job_cron.php
[script_path]/admin/jobmail_cron.php
[script_path]/admin/resumemail_cron.php

Cron job Example  - Linux Control Panel

 55 23 * * * /path/to/php [script_path]/admin/job_cron.php >/dev/null
 56 23 * * * /path/to/php [script_path]/admin/jobmail_cron.php >/dev/null
 57 23 * * * /path/to/php [script_path]/admin/resumemail_cron.php >/dev/null

Or if there is no php you can use lynx:
 55 23 * * * /usr/local/bin/lynx -auth username:password -accept-all-cookies -dump http://www.yourjobsite.com/admin/job_cron.php >/dev/null

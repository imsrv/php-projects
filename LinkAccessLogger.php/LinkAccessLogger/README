I wrote this piece of code to check if anyone visited outdated
links in my project. With this I can track when the placeholder
site was accessed and (if someone followed a link to it instead
of typing it manually) from where the visitor came. Knowing the
source, I can contact the webmaster of that site to update the
link and everybody will be happy.

Before first successful use of the scripts you have to specify
a logfile name in both the read and write scripts, create that
logfile on the server (upload an empty plain text file) and
grant write permission to user, group and world using your
favorite ftp client.

                  for individual proprietors In the case of any performing rights 
                  society subject to a consent decree which provides for the determination 
                  of reasonable license rates or fees to be charged by the performing 
                  rights society, notwithstanding the provisions of that consent 
                  decree, an individual proprietor who owns or operates fewer 
                  than 7 non-publicly traded establishments in which nondramatic 
                  musical works are performed publicly and who claims that any 
                  license agreement offered by that performing rights society 
                  is unreasonable in its license rate or fee as to that individual 
                  proprietor, shall be entitled to determination of a reasonable 
                  license rate or fee as follows:</P>
                <P align=left>(1) The individual proprietor may commence such 
                  proceeding for determination of a reasonable license rate or 
                  fee by filing an application in the applicable district court 
                  under paragraph (2) that a rate disagreement exists and by serving 
                  a copy of the application on the performing rights society. 
                  Such proceeding shall commence in the applicable district court 
                  within 90 days after the service of such copy, except that such 
                  90-day requirement shall be subject to the administrative requirements 
                  of the court.</P>
                <P align=left>(2) The proceeding under paragraph (1) shall be 
                  held, at the individual proprietor's election, in the judicial 
                  district of the district court with jurisdiction over the applicable 
                  consent decree or in that place of holding court of a district 
                  court that is the seat of the Federal circuit (other than the 
                  Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) in which the proprietor's 
                  establishment is located.</P>
                <P align=left>(3) Such proceeding shall be held before the judge 
                  of the court with jurisdiction over the consent decree governing 
                  the performing rights society. At the discretion of the court, 
                  the proceeding shall be held before a special master or magistrate 
                  judge appointed by such judge. Should that consent decree provide 
                  for the appointment of an advisor or advisors to the court for 
                  any purpose, any such advisor shall be the special master so 
                  named by the court.</P>
                <P align=left>(4) In any such proceeding, the industry rate shall 
                  be presumed to have been reasonable at the time it was agreed 
                  to or determined by the court. Such presumption shall in no 
                  way affect a determination of whether the rate is being correctly 
                  applied to the individual proprietor.</P>
                <P align=left>(5) Pending the completion of such proceeding, the 
                  individual proprietor shall have the right to perform publicly 
                  the copyrighted musical compositions in the repertoire of the 
                  performing rights society by paying an interim license rate 
                  or fee into an interest bearing escrow account with the clerk 
                  of the court, subject to retroactive adjustment when a final 
                  rate or fee has been determined, in an amount equal to the industry 
                  rate, or, in the absence of an industry rate, the amount of 
                  the most recent license rate or fee agreed to by the parties. 
                  (6) Any decision rendered in such proceeding by a special master 
                  or magistrate judge named under paragraph (3) shall be reviewed 
                  by the judge of the court with jurisdiction over the consent 
                  decree governing the performing rights society. Such proceeding, 
                  including such review, shall be concluded within 6 months after 
                  its commencement. (7) Any such final determination shall be 
                  binding only as to the individual proprietor commencing the 
                  proceeding, and shall not be applicable to any other proprietor 
                  or any other performing rights society, and the performing rights 
                  society shall be relieved of any obligation of nondiscrimination 
                  among similarly situated music users that may be imposed by 
                  the consent decree governing its operations. (8) An individual 
                  proprietor may not bring more than one proceeding provided for 
                  in this section for the determination of a reasonable license 
                  rate or fee under any license agreement with respect to any 
                  one performing rights society. </P>

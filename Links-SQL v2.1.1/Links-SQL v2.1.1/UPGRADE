UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF LINKS

It's very easy to upgrade your existing copy of Links, or Links SQL
to the latest version. A couple things you should be aware of:

	1. BACKUP YOUR EXISTING COPY AND YOUR SQL DATA BEFORE PROCEEDING! You
	   can do this using MySQLMan if you are using MySQL (using SQL Dump tool).
	2. Links SQL 2 uses the same table names as Links SQL 1, so if you
	   want to install Links SQL 2 in the same database as Links SQL 1,
	   you MUST USE A TABLE PREFIX. This will prefix all your tables
	   so they don't conflict with Links SQL 1.
	3. If you are running under mod_perl, you can NOT run Links 
	   SQL 1.x and Links SQL 2 under the same mod_perl server!

* Upgrading from an existing Links SQL 2.x:

	1. Unarchive the new LinksSQL2.x.x.tar.gz file (windows users can use
	   Winzip (http://www.winzip.com/) to unarchive this file.
	2. FTP in ASCII mode the install.cgi file to your cgi-bin directory and
	   set permissions on this file to 755 (rwxr-xr-x).
	3. FTP in BINARY mode the install.dat file to the same directory.
	4. Point your browser to install.cgi (advanced users can also run it
	   from shell). At the prompt enter the system path to where Links 
	   SQL is currently installed, and select Upgrade.

	Note: You must run the upgrade the same way the program was installed 
	(either from the browser, or from shell).

* Upgrading from Links SQL 1.x

	1. Follow the README instructions and first install Links SQL 2 into a 
	   separate directory.
	2. Goto Database->Import/Export and enter the path to your Links
	   SQL 1.x directory, and the program will import all your links and
	   categories from Links SQL 1.x.

* Upgrading from Links 2.0 (flat file version)
	
	1. Follow the README instructions and install Links SQL into a 
	   separate directory.
	2. Goto Database->Import/Export and enter the path to your Links
	   2.0 directory, and your links and data will be imported.
			
That's it! If you run into any problems, please let us know and we'll
help you out and add the solution to this file for other users.

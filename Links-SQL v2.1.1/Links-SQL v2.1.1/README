1.1 About the Script
----------------------------------------------------
Links SQL is a natural evolution from Links 2.0. Initialy it was
designed to satisfy the need for larger and larger links directories,
something the flat file format of Links 2.0 had troubles with.

In its current form, Links SQL is now a complete rewrite, built and
designed from the ground up to focus on: scalability, modularity
and extensibility. The current Links SQL allows complete freedom from
traditional headaches you may be used to with CGI with such features like:

- Template based output, no editing code to change the look of the program.
- User defined language files, making it easy to provide multiple translations
of your directory.
- Plugin system, allowing you to hook into any aspect of Links SQL, while
sharing plugins with the user community at the same time.

and much more! For more details, please visit our website at:

1.2 System Requirements
----------------------------------------------------
Links SQL is 100% perl, and has no o/s dependent code. System
requirements are:

1. A current version of Perl 5 (version 5.004_04 or better required).
2. Perl database modules: DBI and the appropriate DBD module loaded.
3. A database server. We recommend Mysql 3.22+ -- a lightweight, free,
   and very fast SQL server. It can be downloaded and installed from:

    http://www.mysql.com/

   Links SQL is currently being tested on Oracle and Sybase and should
   be portable without major modifications.

4. Optional: Links SQL will work under mod_perl or mod_fcgi for even faster
   performance! More information about mod_perl can be found:

    http://perl.apache.org/

   Those interested, should also be sure to read the mod_perl guide at:

    http://perl.apache.org/guide/

   More information on Fast CGI can be found at:

    http://www.fastcgi.com/

   This usually requires getting your own dedicated server. If you are
   interested in running a dedicated server with mod_perl and Links SQL,
   we can host your site for reasonable rates.

2. Installation
====================================================
To install Links SQL is very straightforward:

1. Copy the install.dat in BINARY mode to your webserver.
2. Copy the install.cgi in ASCII mode to your webserver.
3. Set the permissions of install.cgi to 755.
4. Set the permissions of the directory you want to install Links SQL into 
   to 777.
5. Run install.cgi from your browser (for advanced users, it can also be
   run from shell. If you do this you can skip steps 3 and 4).
6. Upgrading? If yes:
        If you are upgrading from an existing Links SQL 2.x installation, then
        enter the path to your admin. If you are upgrading from a Links SQL 1.x
        installation, then you must do a new install.
   If no:
        Simply enter in the paths and urls outlined from install.cgi.

That's it!

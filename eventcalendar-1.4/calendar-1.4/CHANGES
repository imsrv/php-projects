Since version 1.3.1

     * Added gettext support for internationalization.  Most of the work
       for this was done by Colorio Mauro <linuxbox@interfree.it>.
     * Added an Italian PO file for the new gettext support (Mauro).
     * Fixed a cosmetic bug in config.pl.
     * config.pl now asks if the DB users need to be created, so if they
       already exist, "make install" won't fail.
     * Removed Postgres version-specific DISTINCT syntax, so a patch is no
       longer necessary for Postgres 7.
     * The "Modify" link is no longer displayed in the event detail view
       if no user is logged in.
     * The login box's SSL notice is no longer displayed when a user is
       logged in.
     * The check to see if a user if "off campus" or not is now
       case-insensitive (as domains should be).
     * Reformatted the code.

Since version 1.3

     * Various bug fixes to make the calendar PHP 4 compatible.

Since version 1.2

     * Fixed a bug where multiple modifications of the same event were not
       handled properly if one of them was approved.
     * Got rid of the unused MakeOCVisible permissions, replaced them with
       configuration permissions.
     * Added the Admin box for calendar configuration.
     * Added the srcconfig table for storing configuration info.
     * Moved $GLOBALS["config_everything"] to $GLOBALS["CONFIG"]["everything"]. 
     * Changed a config varname: computername -> account_host.
     * Boxes now output titles at the beginning of outputForm().
     * Added .green attribute to basic.css for green links.
     * Fixed a bug in SSL detection in login-box.
     * Added new install system.
     * Cleaned up code for auth-shadow executables.
     * Fixed a whole bunch of bugs that were screwing up SQL generation.  Some
       were PHP4 issues, some were just plain dumb.
     * PHP4 seems to handle DB connections a little differently, so the
       connection functions in sql/sql.php3 now store the connections in
       global variables and return those in subsequent calls.

Since version 1.1.1

     * Modify-box now handles events with ID 0 properly.
     * srccalendar=> ALTER TABLE srcevent ADD COLUMN modify_id int4;
     * Added submitted modifications.  (Changes to event, modify-box,
       approve-box, and search-box.)
     * Made the already-existing help for the search box available.

Since version 1.1

     * Fixed a few typos ($GLOBALS[$variable] instead of $GLOBALS["variable"]).
     * Added submitter's name to submission notification.
     * Added check for trailing slash in $config_php_utils.
     * The PAM module should now accept passwords with spaces. (Thanks to
       Andrea Whitlock.)
     * Added a missing AND in delete-box's "next batch" query.  (My old
       professor John Myers stumbled onto this bug.)
     * Fixed MD5 salt detection, needed to call substr.  (Mark Bryant helped
       me find this one.)
     * Calendar no longer depends on the return value of exec in the various
       places where it's called.  (Thanks to Nicholas Waltham and Jason Ford
       for noticing that this broke with PHP 3.0.15.)
     * basic.css now included.

Since version 1.0

   Thanks go to Bruce Tenison for taking the time to implement a few new
   features.
     * Updated INSTALL intructions.
     * Fixed a typo in the approve-box help. (BT)
     * Put Login button before Clear button in login-box. (BT)
     * Put the submit button before Clear in advanced search form.
     * Changed the year displayed in session expiration to 4 digits. (BT)
     * Calendar-box supports highlighting days with events with a lovely
       shade of green. (BT and me).
     * Added a new index table to speed up green highlighting and event
       browsing in general.
     * Implemented e-mail notification of a submitted event. (BT)
     * Implemented e-mail notification of an approved event.
     * Auth-Shadow supports MD5 crypting as well as old-style Unix crypt.
       (BT)
     * Auth-Pam added with support for PAM authentication. (BT)
     * Changed event submission to select on the OID of the previous
       insert, instead of selecting on the entire event, to get the event
       ID.
     * Updated a couple links in the event class to remember the current
       timestamp.
     * Learned about a little SQL concept we like to call "transactions".
       Event submission, modification, and deletion now use transactions
       to avoid inconsistencies in the database.
     * Added a friendlier error message when sessions expire while
       submitting or modifying an event. The user is asked to enable
       cookies, log in, and click the back button a few times to avoid
       re-typing a bunch of stuff.
     * Added a check for enabled cookies. It sets a test cookie and
       passes another variable in the URL to let the page know it should
       check for the test cookie.
     * Login box now notifies user when cookies appear to be disabled.
     * New page - genIndex.php3 - in the calendar directory regenerates
       the index table.
     * Month view feature added which displays all of the month's events,
       similarly to the weekday view.
     * Added a separate config file for a bunch of site-specific settings.
       (BT and me)
     * NIS authentication module courtesy of Scott Moser.

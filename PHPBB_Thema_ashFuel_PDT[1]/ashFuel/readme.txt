I have included the PSD files for this theme, check the _PSD folder.

The font used is called MEST and can be downloaded for free from www.anotherbrushresource.com

There are two CSS files associated with this theme.  The difference is in the TH definition. 
ashFuel.css - uses images that give a little "grunge" type look.
ashFuel2.css (the preset file) - only uses background colors.

Please leave the link to my site in at the bottom, its all I ask for using this theme.

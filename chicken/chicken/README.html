Hello and thanks for using Swobodin's Chicken 0.2!<br />

This PHP script consists of a popular joke, whose the question is "Why
did the chicken cross the road?", answered by famous scientists,
philosophers, managers, and even programming languages and operating
systems.<br />

To use it, you should have a Web server with PHP and MySQL database,
and have some knowledge of how setting them.<br />

Edit config.php and change the variables, then import the content of
"chicken.mysql" to the database.<br />

I gathered, added, modified, translated, removed ... many answers
&nbsp;from many sources; so don't wonder why the most of answers is
in French: I just found them so. If you can contribute by translation,
new characters, development, suggestion, ... any help is welcome, <a href="public.asc">contact me</a>.<br />

The first version was just a text file; I sent it in 2003  by e-mail to some
friends who forwarded it; now I'm still receiving mails from
people I don't know, asking what would some celebrity answer, why I
didn't put him / her ; I noticed it was successful, and had the idea of
making it more popular it using PHP.<br />

Please note that the answers don't express necessary my opinion: they are
just for fun. Furthermore, to not shock some persons, I deleted all
religious answers: Bible, Moises, John Paul II, Budha, Conficius, Tomas
de Torquemeda, ...<br />

All what I want is to have fun, not ennemies!<br />

Things that would be nice to have:

- In addition to listing the file name (or perhaps make it an option), list the 'name' of the snippet instead. This would greatly simplify things for users, for instead of seeing 'index.html' they could see "Home Page", etc.  (config would have "list filename, snippet name, both)
- Ability for admin to select which toolbar options should be enabled/disabled.
- Ability to add custom code snippets from a drop-down list
- Ability to edit entire page, not just snippet.  (ie: <HTML></HTML>)
- Ability to change bg color for a table or cell.

- Add scheduling capability.
- Ability to use the "Link Browser" when adding/modifying an image.
- Clean up the php code.
- Improve the navigation mechanism. Maybe a tree instead?  (I'm open to ideas)
- Make the design more professional. (I'm open to ideas)
- Ability to: (in order of preference)
	1. Have multiple snippets on one page
  	   (http://www.snippetmaster.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=34)
 	2. _OR_ be able to choose which snippet to edit for pages with multiple snippets.
- Finish help file
- Move meta-tag and title editing capability to a different file.
- Ability to see the name of the snippet rather then (or in addition to) file name in the Select page menu
- "Rollback" feature to restore previous versions of a snippet.

<br> <!-- Installing SnippetMaster 
on your website/server has never been easier with our new automated installation, 
SnippetMaster can now automatically install and configures for you step by step. 
The entire installation process should take less then 10 minutes. The basic steps 
involved are outlined below:</p><ol> <li>First Unzip SnippetMaster archive(which 
you already have done to be reading this).<br> </li><li>Upload all files using 
and FTP program to the directory that you will be installing SnippetMaster.</li><li>Access 
the SnippetMaster Control Panel via your web browser to run through the Step-by-Step 
Installation.</li><li>Once everything is configured, you are now ready to run 
your Trial Evaluation of SnippetMaster! --></p><BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>== Install SnippetMaster 
Program Files ==</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>1. Using your FTP program, create a new 
directory on your website to hold the <BR> SnippetMaster program files. </P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>For 
example: <B>/home/username/www/snippetmaster</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>2. Open the 
&quot;includes/config.inc.php&quot; file with a text editor and make any necessary 
adjustments to the default values for each setting. (The file is &quot;self-documenting&quot;. 
This means that there is a description of each setting to help you understand 
what it does and how to adjust it.)</P><P>3. Upload all the SnippetMaster files 
and folders into the new directory.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P> <B>NOTE:</B> The .html 
and .php files MUST be transferred in ASCII format.<BR> The .gif, files MUST be 
transferred in BINARY format.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>4. Start the program to be sure 
it works. The URL you must enter into your browser is the value specified for 
<B>$URL</B> in the config.inc.php file.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>== Configure Client 
Web Pages ==</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>1. Using your web editing tool of choice (Dreamweaver, 
Frontpage, Notepad), open the file that you want your client to be able to edit.<BR>

your client to be able to edit:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P> <B>&lt;snippet name=&quot;You

Change file permissions of the file to at least 666. (File permissions can easily 
be set by using the CHMOD command feature within your FTP program.) </P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>SnippetMaster

Of Using SnippetMaster</B><BR>There are basically two ways you can use SnippetMaster 
to manage your web page content.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Method 1</B></P><P>You simply 
embed the SnippetMaster &lt;snippet&gt; tags around the html code you want to 
make editable. This method works great if you don't normally need to make changes 
to the remaining html code (ie: A Dreamweaver template). If you needed to change 
the remaining html code, you must be sure to download the most current revision 
of the web page before working on it. Otherwise, you might end up overwriting 
any changes your client has made to the editable html code.</P><P><B>Method 2 
- <I>For advanced users only</I></B></P><P>This method is a bit trickier, and 
involves creating a seperate file that contains only the snippet of html code 
you want to make editable.</P><OL> <LI>Create a new file called snippet1.txt that 
contains the html code you want to be editable surrounded by SnippetMaster &lt;snippet&gt; 
tags.<BR><BR></LI><LI>You must now &quot;embed&quot; this file into your web page 
by using a standard Server Side Include or PHP call. ie: &lt;!--#include file=&quot;snippet1.txt&quot;--&gt;</LI></OL><P>Your 
client can edit the html code in snippet1.txt using SnippetMaster whenever they 
choose, and you never need to worry about overwriting any changes they have made

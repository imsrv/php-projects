Requirements
* MySQL 3.21 or later
* PHP 3.04 or later with MySQL support


* Choose a database to use with the link conservatory
Create or choose an existing database to house the conservatory 
tables, item and wing.

* Run build.sql in this database
This creates the two tables.

* put the files in the htdocs directory inside your htdocs directory
This distribution contains two directories, htdocs and modules.  
Copy the contents of the htdocs directory into the root of your Web
server.  With a plain Apache installation this should be called htdocs
and will be inside the main Apache directory.

* put the modules directory in the same directory with htdocs
The modules directory should be copied into the same directory that
contains your document root.  By default the Link Conservatory assumes
this relationship to guess where the modules are.  Your directory might
look like:
Apache/
	htdocs/
	modules/

If you choose to put the modules someplace else, you will have to edit
index.php3 and location.php3.

* edit modules/include/global_settings
The Link Conservatory may be customized by editing global_settings.  If
you change the names of the two gateway scripts, you need to change them
in global settings.  You will need to set up the database information.  You
need to set up addresses for the mailing list.  The Link Conservatory will
work with most list servers.  Lastly, you need to set the SiteURL variable
to reflect the URL to the root of your site.

* edit index.php3 and location.php3
The scripts should work with Apache without modification.  Other Web servers
may require you to edit these files.

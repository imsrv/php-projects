Updates:

06/26/99 - Oversight on our part.  When modifying the code
from our existing lite version of Subscribe Me, we made
html mistakes which render a blank screen for Netscape
users, when adding or deleting their addresses from the lists.

Fixed - Version 2.01

06/26/99 - 

1) Users that enter a carriage return in their
mailing list "Description" box were seeing a \n where the
line breaks should have been.

Example:  This list is designed to for fun.\nEnjoy it!

The fix we've made will properly break the text and remove
the \n's.

Fixed - Version 2.02

2) We found a conflict with the location of the coming
Users Manual and Tutorial.  We've changed the location
that the link points to, and now have it load in its own
window.

Fixed - Version 2.02

3) NT Users using BLAT mail.  Had the "From" and "To"
headers transposed on the mass mailings.

Fixed - Version 2.02

4) We've streamlined version upgrades.  Version 2.0 - 2.01
users, you'll have to delete your:

config.pl
subscribe.pl

unix_mail.pl (UNIX users)
or
nt_mail.pl (NT usres)
blat_mail.pl (NT users)

Then upload the new script files, and reinstall.

From version 2.02 on, the only thing you will need
to do for upgrades:

1) Upload the new script files over the existing ones

setup.pl
subscribe_eng.pl

unixmail_eng.pl (UNIX users)
or
ntmail_eng.pl (NT usres)
blatmail_eng.pl (NT users)

2) Run your Setup.pl file from the browser.  Your
existing configurations should appear.  Simply press
the "Submit Query" button at the bottom of the panel,
and Subscribe Me Pro will update all the files for you.


07/02/99 - Version 2.03

1) When deleting the password.txt file manually, to allow
you to reset your administration password, Subscribe Me
Pro wasn't recongnizing that you needed to reset your
password.

Fixed - Version 2.03

07/16/99 - Version 2.031

1) Some people were receiving multiple Subject lines in
their mailings, when using Sendmail.

Fixed - Version 2.031

2) Confirmation of addition/removal information didn't
contain the actual list name.

Fixed - Version 2.031

3) Pages displayed to customers had unneccessary Javascript
in them.  It caused problems with 3.x series web browsers.
We've removed the Javascript in the pages your customers see.

Fixed - Version 2.031

4) "Double Opt In" mailing list addition confirmation.  Many
people have been requesting the ability to confirm that each
address added to their mailing list was definately added by
the address owner.  We did this with a system we call
"Double Opt In".  Here's how it works:

Your users are NOT automatically added to your lists when they
enter their addresses and press Submit.  They are instantly
sent an e-mail to the address they submitted with instructions
and a link to click.  Once they click the included link, they
are added to your list.  This confirms that they chose to
join your list.  No more nasty e-mails from people that were
added by mistake or by another user.

Added - Version 2.031

07/21/99 - Version 2.032

1) Mistake on our programmers part. Left out a key variable
in the script, which made the "Double Opt In" which made
it impossible for the Double Opt In system to properly function.
Simple fix of less than 1 line of code.  Thanks to David
at Foodweb.com for help spotting it.  Tested fully, no problems.

Fixed - Version 2.032

07/22/99 - Version 2.033

1) Sorry folks, in our rush to release version 2.032,
we released version 2.031 in its place.  Many of you noticed
that the version number didn't change.

We've checked, double checked, and triple checked this time.
Version 2.033 (version 2.032 renamed) is the right version.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

08/23/99 - Version 2.033a

1) Thanks to Michael Rosen, one of our Subscribe Me Professional
users, we were alerted to a potential problem with our present
Double Opt In system.  Apparently, Michael had/has several
lists configured.  Michael helped us spot that our Double Opt
In system was failing when a subscriber was trying to sign up
for multiple lists.  This was more an oversite than an actual
"bug", but thanks to Michael we spotted and fixed the problem.


Beta versions are available by request: subpro@cgiscriptcenter.com

08/23/99 - Version 2.034 Beta 1

1) Added the ability to edit all the HTML response pages
that your customers receive, directly from the administration
panel.  Presently, HTML and BODY tags are still produced by
program, however, you can edit all HTML between those tags.

Added - Version 2.034 Beta 1


2) NT Sockets users were not being able to get Subscribe
Me Professional to send mail via Sockets.  The problem
was due to an error in the installation routine for
NT users.

Fixed - Version 2.034 Beta 1

3) Added the ability to send full HTML e-mails!  By popular
demaned, we've added the ability for Sendmail and Sockets
mailing users to send HTML e-mails to their subscribers.
We were unable to get BLAT mail to properly place the HTML
code inline with the message for this release.  We may support
HTML e-mail for BLAT users at a future date.

Add graphics, colored fonts, and much more.

Added - Version 2.034 Beta 1

09/28/99 - Version 2.034 Beta 2

1) In order to delete your addresses from your mailing lists,
all one would need is a copy of your list(s) files.  Anyone with
access to you FTP account or Telnet rights on your server, or
a smart "hacker" could browse your directories, if you haven't
properly secured them and download the files.  Once he/she had
your lists, he/she could, one by one, delete your addresses.

This did happen with one of our customers, so we've created the
"Double Opt Out" option... this will e-mail a copy of the
removal request to the actual subscriber first.  If the actual
subscriber responds by clicking on the removal request, the address
will be removed.  Otherwise, the address is NOT removed from
your list.

Added - Version 2.034 Beta 2

2)  Several customers reqeusted the ability to "Copy and Paste"
multiple addresses to their mailing lists that have already been
created. This is a great tool for those of you that receive bulk
addresses from other sources. Subscribe Me Pro will even check
the bulk additions for conformity to the e-mail address standards,
errors, duplicates in your existing list, and even unwanted
carriage returns! We've added this functionality in the "Details"
section of each mailing list. Once you are in the "Details"
section, click on the "Edit Manually" button, to bring up the
editing form.

Added - Version 2.034 Beta 2

3)  Some customers were attempting to import lists, but
had forgotten to checkmark the Import List box.  Added a
checking routine to ensure that lists are properly imported.

Fixed - Version 2.034 Beta 2

4)  Some customers forget to choose a mailing list to send to,
when using the Send Mailings feature.  The system would report
back that the mailing had been sent out successfully, when in 
fact no mailing list had been chosen to send to.  Added a checking
routine to ensure that a list must be chosen.

Fixed - Version 2.034 Beta 2

Version 2.034 released 10/03/99


10/25/99 - Version 2.034 Beta 3

1) It appears that we had the Opt Out HTML being sent in the e-mail
and the Opt Out E-mail loading to the screen.  Silly error on our part.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Fixed - Version 2.034 Beta 3 released 10/25/99

2) Our "Batch Address Addition" feature was causing problems when
subscriber's that were added this way could not be removed.
This was caused by a \r return character that could not be seen
by the naked eye, but was picked up on by the program, rendering it
impossible for Subscribe Me Professional to find an address that
is listed in the database.

We've made the necessary changes to keep that from happening to
any future addresses you add, as well as fixing the addresses
you already have added this way, for those of you that have
already used this feature.

Fixed - Version 2.034 Beta 3 released 10/25/99

3) Subscribe Me Professional wrote the outgoing mailing body
to a text file called "message.txt", stored in your /info
directory.

This file was deleted after each mailing so that you can
create a new mailing with new information.

Some of you with very large lists were already starting
on your second mailings before the first one was finished sending,
which caused some data corruption.  Some people on list 2 would
receive e-mails intended for list 1, etc.

We've made each message file unique.  This will keep this kind
of problem from ever occuring again.

Fixed - Version 2.034 Beta 3 released 10/25/99


11/01/99 - Version 2.034 Beta 4

"I love the Double Opt In and Double Opt Out options, however,
its creating these extremely long links that wrap in most
e-mail readers, and therefore don't get highlighted or copied
properly.  Can you do something about that?!"

Yes, we can.  Beta 4 has the following changes:

subscribe.pl becomes s.pl
add becomes a
remove becomes r
list becomes l
email becomes e
pid becomes p

You will need to modify your existing list response screens
yourself.  We don't want to overwrite anything you have
changed.  Make sure that all links sent out in your outgoing
e-mails reflect these:

add becomes a
remove becomes r
list becomes l
email becomes e
pid becomes p

This significantly shortens the links.  Example:

Old link - 
http://www.yourserver.com/cgi-bin/sm/subscribe.pl?remove=1&list=1&email=dirana@elitehost.com&pid=901666

New link -
http://www.yourserver.com/cgi-bin/sm/s.pl?r=1&l=1&e=dirana@elitehost.com&p=901666

That's as short as we can make it.  This should solve the problem
that most or all of your subscribers are experiencing.

#########################
PLEASE NOTE:  IMPORTANT!

IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF SUBSCRIBE ME PRO,
BE SURE TO BACK UP ALL OF YOUR EXISTING MAILING LISTS!  TO DO SO,
LOG INTO YOUR FTP, LOOK FOR THE /LISTS DIRECTORY.  INSIDE OF THIS
DIRECTORY, COPY OUT ALL FILES WITH THE EXTENSION OF .LIST, TO
A SAFE PLACE ON YOUR LOCAL HARD DRIVE.

YOU WILL NEED TO REPLACE THE HTML FORM(S) ON YOUR WEB PAGES WITH
THE NEW CODE FOUND IN THE "DETAILS" SECTION OF EACH LIST.
THIS IS TO ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION SUBMITTED IS SENT TO THE
NEW s.pl FILE RATHER THAN THE OLD subscribe.pl FILE.

<INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="list" VALUE="1">
has also been changed, to:
<INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="l" VALUE="1">

IF YOU COPY AND PASTE THE NEW HTML FOUND IN THE DETAILS SECTION,
THESE CHANGES WILL BE MADE AUTOMATICALLY FOR YOU.             
#########################


Fixed - Version 2.034 Beta 4 released 11/01/99

2) Fixed the fix for "unique message text" files on Beta 3.
If you're using Beta 3, we recommend installing Beta 4.

Fixed - Version 2.034 Beta 4 released 11/01/99


11/08/99 - Version 2.034 Beta 5

1) Added a "Full List Edit" feature, which will allow you to modify
by hand any addresses on your list.  NOTE: Subscribe Me Professionial
will make all addresses lowercase once submitted.  This is done to ensure
that the mail is properly delivered.

Added - Version 2.034 Beta 5 released 11/08/99

2) Added a "List Backup" feature, to allow the administrator to backup his/her
lists from time to time.  Each backup will overwrite the previous backup and
will be stored in your /info directory.  If you are backing up list number 1,
the backup will be called 1.backup.  In order to use it as your main list,
copy it back to the directory as 1.list, overwriting the existing list (assuming
you want to replace the existing list with the backup).

Added - Version 2.034 Beta 5 released 11/08/99


01/04/2000 - Version 2.034 Beta 6

1) Brought to our attention that we overlooked the HTML response page
editing of the "Improperly Formatted Email Address" response screen.
Beta 6 now makes it possilbe to edit this HTML response page.

Added - Version 2.034 Beta 6


2) No more having to "click" the Enter Password box to enter
your administration password.  Simply type it in and press your
Enter key, if so choose.

Added - Version 2.034 Beta 6

3) Modified the Session Management sysetm to reset the timing
each time you click on any link/button in Subscribe Me Pro.  This
ensures that you have a full 30 minutes (or whatever time frame
you choose during setup) from the very last link/button you click.

Added - Version 2.034 Beta 6



02/19/2000 - Version 2.035


1) We've had some users who's text editing program
was adding an additional carriage return to each line when
sending mail.

This was resulting in some mailings with double spaced lines
instead of single spaced lines.  We've placed a filter to watch
for the extra carriage returns and delete them before they
get to the e-mails.

2)  Brought to our attention that our Sendmail mailings were being
rejected by several mail servers for not using CR LF (carriage
return, line feed) at the end of a message.
We've made the necessary modifications.

3)  Added the -f switch for UNIX Sendmail, which will ensure that
bounced e-mails are redirected back to you, the account administrator,
rather than being sent back to your host.

4)  Added List Importing Filters.  Previous versions assumed that
a list you were importing was already checked for bad addresses,
extra carriage returns, multiple addresses, etc.  Imported lists
with bad addresses/information were crashing when attempting to mail
to.  Version 2.035 cleans up your imports, so your mailings will not
crash from bad addresses.

============================================================

Manual Installations
============================================================

We've, so far, only found 1 server that will not allow
Subscribe Me Professional's self-installer to do its job
for you.  That's Best.com/Best.net servers.
If you are installing Subscribe Me Professional on a
Best.com/Best.net web server, you will need to install your
program manually (sorry, we tried to make it simple, but
some hosts just won't let us).


Directories to create:

/sm    

This is your CGI directory.  Permission it 755.  If you are
using Best.com/Best.net, permission it at 710.

Next, we need to create your data directories.  These are
the directories that your Subscribe Me program will write
your data files to.  For security purposes, its best to place
your data directory *outside* your server's web root.  That
means that they won't be avaiable to snooping eyes trying to
locate your subscriber addresses.  Only your Subscribe Me program
will have access to them.  If you are unsure if you have access
to a data directory that isn't accessible from the web, contact
your host to find out, as only they would know.

Create a directory called "s" (or whatever you choose to name it).

/s        <-- Permissioned at 644 to 766, depending on your
server's settings.  If you are on Best.com/Best.net, set this
directory to 730.

Inside the /s directory, create the following directories:
(these directory names must NOT be changed!)
 
  /info 
  /pass
  /maildir
  /tempdir
  /trackdir
  /maildir
  /lists

Permission the directories at 644 to 766, depending on your
server's settings.  If you are on Best.com/Best.net, set this
directory to 730.

Once you've done this, you have no more directories to create or
permission.

Next, create a text file called config.pl (or config.cgi if your
server requires .cgi extensions).  Inside this file, copy and
paste the following information:

#! /usr/bin/perl5

# Full directory path to Perl 5 on your webserver.
$perlpath = "/usr/bin/perl";

# Full directory paths to the following directories
$passfile = "/full/directory/path/to/s/pass";
$memberinfo = "/full/directory/path/to/s/info";
$trackdir = "/full/directory/path/to/s/trackdir";
$tempdir = "/full/directory/path/to/s/tempdir";
$maildir = "/full/directory/path/to/s/maildir";
$lists = "/full/directory/path/to/s/lists";
$graphics = "/full/directory/path/to/s/graphics";

# Place the path to your Mail Program.  If you are using Sendmail
# place the path to Sendmail here.  If you are using BlAT, place
# the directory path to BLAT here.  Contact your host if you are unsure
# of the paths.
$mailprog = "/usr/bin/sendmail";

# To "lock" your data files while being written to, keep the default
# setting of "2" below.  If you are on a Windows95/98 web server, you
# may have to remove the "2" as Windows95/98 doesn't allow "File Locking".
# Such as:  $LOCK_EX = "";
# WE RECOMMEND LEAVING THE DEFAULT SETTINGS
$LOCK_EX = "2";

# Place your site URL path here
$websiteurl = "http://www.airtreks.com";

# If you are on a UNIX machine, place "unix" between the quotes.
# If you are on an NT machine, place "nt" between the quotes.
$os = "unix";

# If you are using Sendmail, place "sendmail" between the quotes.
# If you are using Sockets mail, place "sockets" between the quotes.
# If you are using BLAT mail, place "blat" between the quotes.
# We recommend anyone considering using BLAT mail to use Sockets instead.
$mailusing = "sendmail";

# If you are using Sockets mail, place the URL path to your SMTP mail server here.
# Contact your host for the correct URL, if you are unsure.
$smtp_addr = "mail.yourserver.com";

# Place the full directory path to your CGI directory here.  This is the directory
# that your CGI scripts are kept in.
$cgipath = "/full/directory/path/to/sm";

# Place the full directory path to your Data directory here.  This is the directory
# that your data files are stored/written to.
$information = "/full/directory/path/to/s";

# If your server requires .pl extensions, place .pl between the quotes.
# If your server reqiures .cgi extensions, place .cgi between the quotes.
$extension = "pl";

# If you wish to receive notification of new signups and removals, leave the
# default setting of "ON" between the quotes.
# If you choose not to receive notifications of signups and removals, place
# the word "OFF" between the quotes below.
$notification = "ON";

# Here you can set the amount of time that your "Session Management" password
# will stay active.  The time is measured in seconds, so 1800 seconds equals
# 30 minutes.
$config_session = "1800";


# This setting will not matter if you have installed this manually.  No change
# is necessary here.
$permissions = "0755";

# Do not change this line
$ready = "1";

# Do not change this line
1;


# The end of your configuration file - Do not change this line


Once you've copied and pasted the above to your config.pl (or config.cgi)
file, you can then modify the settings as needed.  Then, save the file
and upload it to your /sm (your CGI script) directory.  Give it the
same permission settings as your other CGI script files, permissioned at
644 to 766, depending on your server's settings.  If you are on
Best.com/Best.net, set this directory to 730.

Lastly, rename:

subscribe_eng.pl  --> s.pl
unixmail_eng.pl  --> unix_mail.pl

Once you've renamed the two files, open each in a text editor and add
the following lines to the top of each file, respectively:

#! /usr/bin/perl
require "/full/directory/path/to/your/config.pl";
require "/full/directory/path/to/your/unix_mail.pl";

The above gets pasted to your s.pl file.

#! /usr/bin/perl
require "/full/directory/path/to/your/config.pl";

The above gets pasted to your unix_mail.pl file.

Save both files and upload them to your CGI script directory, along
with your config.pl file.  Give it the same permission settings as
your other CGI script files, permissioned at 644 to 766, depending
on your server's settings.  If you are on Best.com/Best.net, set this
directory to 730.


Once you've done the above, you are ready to go!  Call the /s.pl file
from your web browser.  If you've done your installation correctly, you
should be asked to set your administration password.

Installation Instructions for PHPOpenChat 2.x
---------------------------------------------

INTODUCTION
===========

Requirements:
-------------
Before you install PHPOpenChat you need to install the following things
* Linux ;-) or an other UNIX! Win32 is not recommended for a high performance chat.
* MySQL database (http://www.mysql.com/)
* Apache (http://www.apache.org/) with the PHP3 (version >=3.0.9) or 
  PHP4 module (http://www.php.net/)
  - because of an error into php 4.0.3 code in mysql_close function, 
    we recommend php version >= 4.0.4 this bug concerns only php4 
    (but a workaround for 4.0.3 is implemented yet)

System usage:
-------------
* CPU: You can calculate this with the number of users times factor four. 
       This means, for a planned chat of 200 online chatters you need a 
       CPU clock frequency of 800 MHz

INSTALL
=============
$ cd <blafoo> (this is a dummy directory)
$ gunzip -c phpopenchat-2.x.tar.gz | tar xf -
Edit apache's httpd.conf file and 
- set the DocumentRoot to "<blafoo>/phpopenchat-2.x/html" 
- add "AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3" for PHP3 or
- add "AddType application/x-httpd-php .php" for PHP4
- add "DirectoryIndex index.html index.php"

Edit php's php.ini (mostly in /usr/local/lib [unix] or in C:\WINDOWS [win32]) 
and set the include_path to "<blafoo>/phpopenchat-2.x/includes"
be sure mysql support is enabled and safe_mode is set to Off.
If you can't change the include_path, move all files from directory 
/includes to /html.
IMPORTANT, most ISPs switches this mode to On for safety reasons, 
so it makes no sense to install phpopenchat there! 
Explanation: If the safe mode are enabled we can't change php.ini 
variables during chat's runtime and that is what we need in output.php, 
a script which never ends.

If you don't have already a MySQL database account:
Create a database user "phpopenchat" on your mysql database:
shell> mysql mysql
mysql> INSERT INTO user VALUES('localhost','phpopenchat',PASSWORD('<your password>'),
                              'Y','Y','Y','Y','N','N','N','N','N','N','N','N','N','N');
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


Create a database "phpopenchat":
shell> mysqladmin create phpopenchat

Import PHPOpenChat's data:
Unix:
shell> mysql phpopenchat < <blafoo>/phpopenchat-2.x/db.schema
Win32:
Please use the command line tools of MySQL!
If you use MySQLManager even so, then delete all semicolon from the db.schema and import every
SQL-instruction singly.

Edit <blafoo>/phpopenchat-2.x/includes/defaults_inc.php and:
IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT! 
change the text in the variable $pass_phrase to what ever you want and set:

$DATABASENAME to "phpopenchat";
$DATABASEUSER to "phpopenchat";
$DATABASEPASSWD to "<your password>";
(certainly you can use an exsisting MySQL accout)
$DATABASEHOST to "localhost";
$INSTALL_DIR to the WEBSERVER directory where you installed the chat
$CHATSERVERNAME to the dns name where your chat runs (without trailing slash)

Win32:
If you enable session support you have to create a directory named 'tmp' on drive c:, because 
PHP wants to store the session data there.
In a dos shell type:
> c: [ENTER]
> mkdir tmp [ENTER]
Or you set session.save_path to an existing 
directory within php.ini.

Under Unix, give the webserver process write access to the directory '<blafoo>/phpopenchat-2.x/html/images'.
(For the upload of user images)

IMPORTANT! Protect the chat administration directory 'http://<your chat's dns name>/<install dir>/admin/'

Now you find the chat at http://<your chat's dns name>/<install dir>

Administration:
---------------
The chat's administration section resides at http://<your chat's dns name>/admin/
You will find the following buttons:
* Messages:
  This messages will be displayed in the chat randomly.

* Channels:
  Here you can set values like color of nickname, background color of text frame, ... 
  and you be able to create new channels.
  NOTE: If you rename the channel 'Channel_1' you have to change the 
  value of the variable $ENTRYCHANNELNAME in defaults_inc.php as well!

* Godfathers:
  Has special rights. They can ban users by means of the ignore user dialog.

* Co-Moderators:
  If the channel is moderated co-moderators can read all the text lines.

* VIPs:
  - vip: can 'speak' directly to everybody and can read the moderated text lines only.
  - channel: the concerned channel.
  - moderator: he can edit and accept or not the 'spoken' text lines. 
    The moderator can see every text line except the wispered lines.

Edit the html-templates (within the 'includes'-directory. The file names containing '_tpl') 
to realize your own chat design.

To add an icon by hand which can be used in the chat by an user, you must copy a GIF-image 
to <blafoo>/phpopenchat-2.x/html/images/chatter/ only.
The user can call this icon in the chat by typing ':me'. 
Other chatters have to use ':you' while they speak to him.

Image name conventions:
All letters in lowercase and ' ' becomes to '_'.
Examples:
elwood             = elwood.gif
JAKE               = jake.gif
Matt Guitar Murphy = matt_guitar_murphy.gif
Mr. Fabulous	   = mr._fabulous.gif

That's it

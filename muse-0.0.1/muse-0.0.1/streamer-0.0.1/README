Thanks to Jack Moffitt, Barath Raghavan, and Alexander Haväng for writing
icecast and providing me with bits of code from shout.

DESCRIPTION:
Icecast is an mp3 streamer for broadcasting network radio. It comes with a
simple streamer called shout. However, the timing code in shout is delicate and
icecast doesn't react well to really latent streams.

So, here is streamer, an mp3 streamer for icecast which doesn't suffer from
timing problems. The program forks into a streamer and a file handling child.
The parent uses cunning non-blocking things to communicate with the file
handling child so it never stops streaming. Meanwhile, the child deals with my
stunningly slow cd changer which takes about five seconds to unmount the cds,
swap the current slot, remount and map a file into memory.

It works for me <g>.

USAGE:
Edit the hardcoded hostname, file paths and port numbers.
Make
Enjoy.
You'll need a program called playlist.pl which will write on stdout the name of
an mp3 when called as "playlist.pl next".

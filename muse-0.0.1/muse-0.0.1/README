DESCRIPTION:

Muse is a complete web based playlist manager for icecast released and written
under the GPL. It uses a single php3 web page, a perl playlist manager and a
file streamer written by me.

Muse allows users to add, remove randomise and request tracks using a web
interface. Two playlists are used. The main list cycles infinitely. However,
users can request tracks for the request list, which will be played before any
new main list tracks.

Muse can also be used away from the web through the (rather rudimentary) perl
interface. Commands include add, remove, list, listnow, skip, randomise and
info.

A complete setup consists of many independent parts. Icecast sits in the middle
accepting connections from user clients such as xmms, mpg123 and winamp as well
as streaming clients such as streamer and shout. Httpd accepts connections from
users, it runs the php3 interface which in turn executes the perl playlist
manager. This edits playlist files and sends signals to streamer which is
permanently connected to icecast.

And now for a really confusing diagram.......

Please read all the instructions before starting.

1. mysql -u root -p intranet < setup.sql
(assumes database "intranet" already exists; if it doesn't, you should
create it first)
This takes care of WebCalendar's tables, too. You can log into WebCalendar
as admin with the password admin or sgreathouse with the password password.
IF YOU ARE UPGRADING from 0.2.6 or lower to any higher version, you should:
mysql -u root -p intranet < upgrade0.2.7.sql
IF YOU ARE UPGRADING from 0.2.7 or lower to any higher version, you should:
mysql -u root -p intranet < upgrade0.2.8.sql
2. Move the .tar.gz archive to the location where you want it installed
(e.g., /usr/local/apache/htdocs/) and
tar -zxvf bhcintranet.tar.gz
It will create a directory called "intranet" and put all of the files and
directories under that.
3. Point your workstation's web browser at 
http://whatever.the.server.is.called/path/to/files/               
4. Use "sgreathouse" for the login name and "password" for the password.
5. Go to "Setup" and add yourself as a user. (Use the pull-down menu to
change "sgreathouse" to "CREATE NEW USER" and click "Go")  Make sure you
give yourself all possible priviledges and that the IP address matches the
static IP of your workstation. If you do not have a static IP address, your
users will have to log in at least once. All IP addresses must be unique --
you will not be able to add a user with a duplicate address, login name,
or machine name!
6. Look at config.php and edit as needed.
7. If everything is working, you'll want to delete sgreathouse from the users.
Also, create a WebCalendar account for yourself with admin priviledges and
delete both the admin and sgreathouse accounts.
8. If you want dependable security, you should now 
	mv staff.users /usr/local/apache/ 
	mv *.sh /root/bin
	mv bhcintranet.htaccess .htaccess
and use Setup (or phpMyAdmin) to change all of the users' IP addresses to 
values that are unique and not possible... for example, you might choose
001, 002, 003 and so on.
9. If you want to use the Upload program, you should 
	mv *.sh /root/bin
(skip this if you did it in the previous step)
	cat root.cron >> /var/spool/cron/root 
10. If you want to use phpMyAdmin and the WebCalendar, you will have to modify
additional config files. They are:
	phpMyAdmin/config.inc.php
	calendar/includes/config.inc
Just use the same MySQL user and password as you did in config.php
11. Some of the scripts assume that you are using WinPopUp on your workstations and
that you have Samba installed. With the Windows monopoly, that is pretty much the
closest thing to a universal instant messaging standard that I could think of. Sick,
I know.
12. If you have problems with seeing the source code of scripts instead of them
executing as you would expect, make sure apache is setup to parse .php files (in
addition to .php3 files).

0.2: First public release
0.2.1: Some scripts still had the pre-0.2 hard coded
mysql_connect statments; this release made it so you
only have to change the password once in each of
three files:
	config.php
	calendar/includes/config.inc
	phpMyAdmin/config.inc.php3
Plus, I'm not giving my MySQL password out to the 
whole world anymore.
0.2.2: Improved a bug in the timesheet.php script
that caused dates to be displayed incorrectly.
0.2.3: The time sheet administrator can no longer
easily delete those time sheets that users have not
marked done. The time sheet admin must now change
the status of the time sheet to "done" before the
delete icon will be shown next to it in a list.
A bug with the colors in the setup.php script was
fixed.
0.2.4: Fixed bug in system administrator message
section of news.php.
Fixed possible bug in identity.php script.
Changed location of "LOGOUT" link in menu.php (only
shows up if you are using the scripts from an IP
address other than what you have set for yourself
in the database).
0.2.5: Previous versions had a typo in several of 
the WebCalendar scripts which caused an error message;
that has been fixed.
Added the default WebCalendar user "admin" (password:
admin) and changed the default WebCalendar user "scott"
to "sgreathouse" (password: password) for consistency.
0.2.6: Fixed error in setup.sql
Fixed bug which caused weird problems if you tried to 
create a new user with one of the indexed fields blank
(login, ipaddress and machinename). The script now
returns an error in this case and if you try to create
a new user with one of those fields duplicating an
existing user.
Fixed bug in printer friendly display of contact log.
0.2.7: Upgraded WebCalendar to 0.9.22 (This is the first
WebCalendar upgrade included with this package. Make
sure to read the UPGRADING doc in the calendar directory
if you are upgrading! You need to create a new table.)
Upgraded phpMyAdmin to 2.1.0 (got rid of the customized
color scheme and page header in the process).
0.2.8: Contact log now allows you to see call-backs for
the next 24 hours, week, 30 days, or year -- this was
implemented to help those people who compulsively print
everything to use less paper. 
Fixed problem with quotes.php (wasn't using header).
Fixed problem with printer friendly version of time
sheet (wouldn't let time sheet administrator print
other people's time sheets).
0.2.9: Fixed problem with time sheet administrator's page 
(undeleting one time sheet undeleted all of them).
Fixed problem with password sharing being set to "No"
anytime a non-administrator changed any of their
settings (again, you shouldn't even be using this!).

FAQs:

Q: When I try to login, I get sent back to the login page with no error.
A: Make sure that you built PHP with --enable-track-vars during the
   configure step.  Make sure your browser has cookies enabled.  Either
   of these can cause this problem.

Q: Does WebCalendar work under Windows?
A: I've received confirmation of someone using WebCalendar using
   MS Access with ODBC and another using Oracle.

Q: Does it work with PHP 4?
A: Yep.

Q: Does it work with PHP 3?
A: Yep.

Q: Why do quotations not enter into the database properly?
A: The system is designed to work with PHP's magic quotes feature
   that automatically adds backslashes for you.  (This is configurable
   in php.ini.)

Q: I'd like to translate WebCalendar into another language.  What do I do?
A: It's a fairly simple process.  If you've ever translated a C-based app
   that used GNU's gettext tool, then you'll have no problem.  The I18N
   support was based on GNU's gettext.  Here's what you need to do.
   - look in the "translations" directory
   - copy the "English-US.txt" file into what you'd like to call your
     language data file.  (e.g. "cp English-US.txt French.txt")
   - Now translate all the text to the _right_ of the ":" into the
     new language.  Do _not_ alter the text to the left of the ":".
   - When you're done making changes, move into the "tools" directory.
     Run the check_translation.pl script on your new data file to make
     sure you have all the needed translations.
     (e.g. "./check_translation.pl.pl ../translations/French.txt")
   - Add the new language to the $languages array defined in
     includes/config.inc.
   - Optionally, change the default language specified as $LANGUAGE
     in includes/config.inc.
   - Test it out...
   - Email a copy of the new .txt data file to cknudsen@radix.net.

Q: Why aren't you using PHP4 sessions or PHPLIB sessions?
A: It would really be overkill for what the application needs.  It also
   simplifies installation by not requiring PHPLIB or PHP4.  A future
   version might switch to PHP4 sessions as PHP4 becomes more common.

Q: Is there an online demo?
A: Yes, there is.  User "demo" for login and "demo" for password at:
   http://webcalendar.sourceforge.net/demo/

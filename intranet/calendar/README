- Exporting to Palm Pilot (via install-datebook, part of pilot-link)
  Note: install-datebook must be patched and rebuilt since it has
  a big old bug in it.  See INSTALL for instructions.

Requirements:
- PHP (3 or 4)
- Database: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL or ODBC

Recommended:
- JavaScript-enabled browser
- CSS-enabled browser
- Cookie-enabled browser
- pilot-link (if exporting): http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=2158

Outstanding issues:
- Checking for schedule conflicts does not check against repeating events
  other than the initial event
- No way to delete just a specific day of a repeating event
- No way to override the time of just a specific day of a repeating event
- Complete translatations (most are missing the translations for stuff
  related to repeating events)
- Compatibility testing with Mozilla/Netscape6

Possible features for future releases:
- LDAP support
- User groups
- Custom access restrictions that can be defined by each user
- Some kind of shared public calendars.  Perhaps multiple shared public
  calendars that can be overlayed onto your own calendar.
- Allow users to not have JavaScript and/or CSS used
- An optional "guest" login that will let you view users' public events
- Allow week to start on Monday or Sunday
- Advances search (date ranges, and/or)
- Add comments to entries that will show up on the view page
- Data import (from Netscape Calendar's tab-delimted export or maybe
  from a Palm Pilot data file)
- Add support for repeating events to install-datebook
- Activity log
- Java client?

phpMyAdmin - Todo

phpMyAdmin 2.1.0 is probably the latest release in the 2.0 tree; 
development will focus on version 3.0 after this. phpMyAdmin 3.0
will contain a database abstraction layer, allowing it to be used
with Postgres and other databases.
Version 3.0 will also require at least one additional table, for 
the first time. Until now, I've tried to avoid this, but it is
really necessary for certain features (like saving preferences and
custom SQL queries).
You can expect 3.0 in the end of 2000, I hope.

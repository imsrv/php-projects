Introduction
------------

XSilver is a Geeklog (http://www.geeklog.net) theme. This theme has
been tested on the following browsers.

Windows - Netscape 4.78, Netscape 6.2, Internet Explorer 6.0, Opera 6
Linux - Konquerer 2.2.1, Mozilla 0.9.4, Galleon 0.12.1



Installation
------------

Option 1. Put the tarball in your public_html directory and extract the
tarball, then select your preferences link in Geeklog, and you
should now have the option to select this theme.

Option 2. Extract package locally and upload the theme folder "XSilver" into
your layout directory.



Caveats
-----------

This software has been tested only with Geeklog 1.3.3. There are several known
factors you will need to consider before installing this software.

1. In file lib-common.php, there is no call for the layout_url variable for
function Com_endblock, therefore I'm "hard-coding" the theme name in the
blockfooter, please make the necessary adjustments if you wish to change the
theme name.

2. In file lib-common.php, the comments have no style element, therefore they
render black text on the dark background. I have rectified this for my Geeklog
by adding commentbar4 to the stylesheet and to the appropraite table cells in
the lib-common.php file. If you need help determining how to do this, please
email me.

3. This theme is not W3 validated HTML, although it's a goal I have in mind. I
did not do too much to the calendar to stream-line the look. I have to leave
something for you to do! :)

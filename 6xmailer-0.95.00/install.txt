==============================================================================

These scripts in this zip file or tarball are only at the BETA stage of production and have
not been fully tested in a production environment.

============
Requirements
============

This mail reader was written with PHP 4.0.4PL1 running on the development server. I am not
sure if all the commands used or limited to this version of PHP as of this time, if someone
would please test it on earlier version and tell me the results.

These are the following requirements to use 6XMailer:
	* An operating system that supports and has TCP/IP installed 
	* A web server that supports and has PHP 4 installed with the IMAP extensions installed 
	  enabled 
	* A POP3 server and a SMTP server 
	* A web browser with cookie and POST support 
	* mySQL

Recommended setup:
	* OS: Linux 2, Windows 9x/Me, Windows NT/2000 
	* WWW Server: Apache 1.3x, Personal Web Server 4.0, IIS 4.0 or better 
	* PHP: The latest version PHP with the IMAP extensions.
	* Browser: Internet Explorer 4.0 or better, Netscape Communicator 6.0 or better,
	* Mozilla 0.6 or better 

============
Installation
============

Once you have obtained a copy of 6XMailer, you need to setup your web server the way you
wish to host the mailer scripts and make sure these directories have the proper permissions.
Later I will add separate section for each web server and how to configure them in any
number of ways to host 6XMailer.

Once you have configured your web server and created the directory for the scripts,
decompress the zip or tarball to that directory with the option to restore the directory
structure. With that done, open the config.php and edit it to match your network's or
server's configuration. For more information about the config.php file refer to the
Configuration section. The SMTP configuration is controlled by the php.ini file.

You must also enabled the IMAP extensions in PHP to use this script.  First make sure that
the extensions are compiled acording to the PHP documents.  Then, open you php.ini file and
find a line (if you compiled the extensions as a seperate module) that reades
;extension=php_imap.dll, or what ever name the module compiled under, and remove the ";"
from in front of the line.  Then restart your web-server if necessary.

Once you are finished editing the settings file, run the file in the SQL directory with
mySQL as follows, you may edit the database name in the sql files:

	If you are installing 6XMailer for the first time run setup_new.sql.
	If you upgrading from a previous version run the file update_from_(version).sql,
	replacing (version) with the version you are upgrading from.  This will not delete
	existing data in the address books or user settings database.

Then go into your php.ini file and find a setting called register_globals and set it to
Off. Then find the track_vars and set it to On. If you can't change this settings in
php.ini because of other scripts running on your server, then simply go into the your
Apache configuration file httpd.conf or in the .htaccess for the 6XMailer if you running
Apache (which I recommend) and change these settings by adding these lines:

php_flag register_globals off
php_flag track_vars on

in the <Directory> or <VIRTUALHOST> sections that host 6XMailer, or in the .htaccess file
that is in the directory that contains 6XMailer.

	
=============
Configuration
=============

Most of the configuration of 6XMailer is controller by the config.php script, the SMTP
portion of the configuration is in the php.ini file.

	This is the port that your POP3 server is listening on, this usually defaults to 110.

	This value is used to add the domain part of the e-mail address to the end of usernames.
	NOTE: Do not set this if your username is your e-mail address.

These are settings in your php.ini that define the SMTP server information that the mailer
will ues to send e-mail.

	message are from, this is never used by 6XMailer as it sends an e-mail under the name
	of the logged on user.

sendmail_path
	This is the path and command line of the sendmail binary on any system that uses or
	has sendmail installed. Typically this is not used on any Microsoft based machine.

------------
Text Strings
------------

This section of config.php contains several strings of text used by the mailer that you and
safely customize.

$MailSystemTitle
	This is the title of the mailer system, this can be the name of your company or some
	code name, it's up to you.

$QuoteInReply
	This is the text that is placed between the original and the reply message when
	replying to an e-mail.

--------------
Other settings
--------------

These are other settings in the config.php file that will allow you to customize and
configure the mailer.

$Language

	documentation, and about page. Language files and scripts or stored in the lang
	directory. This defaults to English.

	the mailer. A theme is a collection of style sheets, setting scripts, and image files.
	Themes are stored in the themes directory.

	the Mail List. It's default is 600 (10 minutes)

	this size ends in a "M", or "k" then the the size will be based on a Megabyte or kilobyte.
	If no ending exists then the size is in bytes.  The ending is case insensitive.  No
	setting or a setting of 0 with any ending means no limit.

These scripts in this zip file or tarball are only at the BETA stage of production and have
not been fully tested in a production environment.

The documents and user's manual are located in the documents directory.

NOTE: You must check the configuration file to make sure that the mailer will work with your
system, if not, problems may occur.

Please refer to the install.txt file for requirements, installation instructions, and
configuration information.  ALWAYS!!!  Since this script is im BETA, these instructions
will change.

If anyone would like to help me with coding, documentation, or any other aspect of this
mailer such as themes or language packs, then goto www.sixxgate.da.ru and e-mail me at the

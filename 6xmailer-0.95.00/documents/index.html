<H2><a name="c3">Obtaining the Latest Copy</a></H2>
<p>To obtain the latest copy of 6XMailer, then visit 6XGate Systems' web site at: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.sixxgate.da.ru">www.sixxgate.da.ru</a>. &nbsp;There will also be archived copies of previous releases as well. &nbsp;The best way to support 6XMailer is to use it.</p>

<H2><a name="c4">From the Readme File</a></H2>
<p>These scripts in this zip file or tarball are only at the BETA stage of production and have not been fully tested in a production environment.</p>
<p>The documents and user's manual are located in the documents directory.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> &nbsp;You must check the configuration file to make sure that the mailer will work with your system, if not, problems may occur.</p>
<p>Please refer to the install.txt file for requirements, installation instructions, and configuration information. &nbsp;<b>ALWAYS!!!</b> &nbsp;Since this script is im BETA, these instructions will change.</p>
<p>If anyone would like to help me with coding, documentation, or any other aspect of this mailer such as themes or language packs, then goto <a href="http://www.sixxgate.da.ru">www.sixxgate.da.ru</a> and e-mail me at the e-mail address under the Contacting Us page.</p>

<H2><a name="c5">Requirements</a></H2>
<p>This mail reader was written with PHP 4.0.4PL1 running on the development server. &nbsp;I am not sure if all the commands used or limited to this version of PHP as of this time, if someone would please test it on earlier version and tell me the results.</p>
<p>These are the following requirements to use 6XMailer:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An operating system that supports and has TCP/IP installed</li>
	<li>A web server that supports and has PHP 4 installed with the IMAP extensions installed enabled</li>
	<li>A POP3 server and a SMTP server</li>
	<li>A web browser with cookie and POST support</li>
	<li>mySQL</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended setup:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>OS:</b> &nbsp;Linux 2, Windows 9x/Me, Windows NT/2000</li>
	<li><b>WWW Server:</b> &nbsp;Apache 1.3x, Personal Web Server 4.0, IIS 4.0 or better</li>
	<li><b>PHP:</b> &nbsp;The latest version PHP with the IMAP extensions.</li>
	<li><b>Browser:</b> &nbsp;Internet Explorer 4.0 or better, Netscape Communicator 6.0 or better, Mozilla 0.6 or better</li>
</ul>

<H2><a name="c6">Installation</a></H2>
<p>Once you have obtained a copy of 6XMailer, you need to setup your web server the way you wish to host the mailer scripts and make sure these directories have the proper permissions. &nbsp;Later I will add separate section for each web server and how to configure them in any number of ways to host 6XMailer.</p>
<p>Once you have configured your web server and created the directory for the scripts, decompress the zip or tarball to that directory with the option to restore the directory structure. &nbsp;With that done, open the config.php and edit it to match your network's or server's configuration. &nbsp;For more information about the <i>config.php</i> file refer to the Configuration section. &nbsp;The SMTP configuration is controlled by the <i>php.ini</i> file.</p>
<p>You must also enabled the IMAP extensions in PHP to use this script. &nbsp;First make sure that the extensions are compiled acording to the PHP documents. &nbsp;Then, open you <i>php.ini</i> file and find a line (if you compiled the extensions as a seperate module) that reades <b>;extension=php_imap.dll</b>, or what ever name the module compiled under, and remove the &quot;<b>;</b>&quot; from in front of the line. &nbsp;Then restart your web-server if necessary.</p>
<p>Once you are finished editing the settings file, run the file in the SQL directory with mySQL as follows, you may edit the database name in the sql files:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you are installing 6XMailer for the first time run <i>setup_new.sql</i>.</li>
	<li>If you upgrading from a previous version run the file <i>update_from_(version).sql</i>, replacing <i>(version)</i> with the version you are upgrading from. &nbsp;This will not delete existing data in the address books or user settings database.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then go into your <i>php.ini</i> file and find a setting called <b>register_globals</b> and set it to  <b>Off</b>.  Then find the <b>track_vars</b> and set it to <b>On</b>.  If you can't change this settings in <i>php.ini</i> because of other scripts running on your server, then simply go into the your Apache configuration file <i>httpd.conf</i> or in the <i>.htaccess</i> for the 6XMailer if you running Apache (which I recommend) and change these settings by adding these lines:</p>
	<blockquote>php_flag register_globals off<br>php_flag track_vars on</blockquote>
<p>in the <b>&lt;Directory&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;VIRTUALHOST&gt;</b> sections that host 6XMailer, or in the <i>.htaccess</i> file that is in the directory that contains 6XMailer.</p>


<H2><a name="c7">Configuration</a></H2>
<p>Most of the configuration of 6XMailer is controller by the config.php script, the SMTP portion of the configuration is in the php.ini file.</p>

<H3><a name="c7-1">POP3 Server</a></H3>
